# Integration Patterns Documentation

**Navigation**: [Home](../../index.md) > [API Reference](../index.md) > Integration Patterns

## Overview

Integration Patterns provide guidance on how to effectively combine multiple Azure DevOps APIs to solve common real-world scenarios. While individual API documentation focuses on specific methods and their usage, integration patterns demonstrate how these APIs work together to create comprehensive solutions.

## Purpose

The Integration Patterns documentation is designed to:

- Demonstrate practical, real-world usage scenarios that span multiple APIs
- Provide end-to-end code examples for common integration workflows
- Illustrate best practices for combining different Azure DevOps services
- Help developers understand the relationships between different APIs
- Accelerate development by offering reusable patterns for common tasks

## What's Included

This documentation covers key integration patterns between the most commonly used Azure DevOps APIs:

- [Work Item + Git Integration](./work-item-git-integration.md) - Patterns for integrating work item tracking with source control
- [Work Item + Build Integration](./work-item-build-integration.md) - Patterns for connecting work items with build pipelines
- [Git + Build Integration](./git-build-integration.md) - Patterns for automating builds based on repository events
- [Cross-API Examples](./cross-api-examples.md) - Complex scenarios involving three or more APIs
- [API Cross-Reference Table](./api-cross-reference-table.md) - Comprehensive table showing relationships between API methods

## Common Integration Scenarios

Integration patterns address several common scenarios in Azure DevOps workflows:

- **Traceability**: Linking work items to code changes, builds, and releases
- **Automation**: Triggering actions in one service based on events in another
- **Reporting**: Gathering data across multiple services for comprehensive reporting
- **Synchronization**: Keeping information consistent across different systems
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinating complex processes across multiple services

## Prerequisites

To use these integration patterns, you'll need:

- An Azure DevOps account with appropriate permissions
- A Personal Access Token (PAT) with scopes for all relevant services
- The Azure DevOps Node.js API client library
- Familiarity with the individual APIs being integrated

## Getting Started

To implement these integration patterns, first establish a connection to your Azure DevOps organization and obtain the necessary API clients:

```typescript
import * as azdev from "azure-devops-node-api";

// Connection setup
const orgUrl = "https://dev.azure.com/yourorganization";
const token = "your-personal-access-token";

const authHandler = azdev.getPersonalAccessTokenHandler(token);
const connection = new azdev.WebApi(orgUrl, authHandler);

// Get API clients for integration
const witApi = await connection.getWorkItemTrackingApi();
const gitApi = await connection.getGitApi();
const buildApi = await connection.getBuildApi();

// Now you can implement the integration patterns
// using these API clients together
```

## API Relationships

The following describes the relationships between the primary APIs covered in these integration patterns:

**API Relationship Structure:**
- The Core API (Projects & Teams) serves as the central component
- Three main APIs branch from the Core API:
  - Git API (Code & Repositories)
  - Work Item Tracking API
  - Build API
- These three APIs have bidirectional relationships with each other
- All APIs contribute to Integration Patterns

For a detailed breakdown of how specific methods relate to each other, see the [API Cross-Reference Table](./api-cross-reference-table.md).

## Key API Methods Used in Integration Patterns

### Work Item Tracking API

- [getWorkItem](../work-item-tracking/methods/get-work-item.md) - Retrieve a single work item
- [getWorkItems](../work-item-tracking/methods/get-work-items.md) - Retrieve multiple work items
- [createWorkItem](../work-item-tracking/methods/create-work-item.md) - Create a new work item
- [updateWorkItem](../work-item-tracking/methods/update-work-item.md) - Update an existing work item
- [queryByWiql](../work-item-tracking/methods/query-work-items.md) - Execute WIQL queries

### Git API

- [getRepositories](../git-api/top-5-methods.md#getrepositories) - List all Git repositories
- [getRepository](../git-api/top-5-methods.md#getrepository) - Get a specific Git repository
- [getRefs](../git-api/top-5-methods.md#getrefs) - Get branches and tags
- [getPullRequests](../git-api/top-5-methods.md#getpullrequests) - Get pull requests
- [createPullRequest](../git-api/top-5-methods.md#createpullrequest) - Create a new pull request

### Build API

- [getDefinitions](../build-api/top-5-methods.md#getdefinitions) - Get build pipelines
- [getBuild](../build-api/top-5-methods.md#getbuild) - Get a specific build
- [getBuilds](../build-api/top-5-methods.md#getbuilds) - Get multiple builds
- [queueBuild](../build-api/top-5-methods.md#queuebuild) - Queue a new build
- [getBuildLogs](../build-api/top-5-methods.md#getbuildlogs) - Get build logs

## Best Practices for API Integration

When implementing integration patterns, consider these best practices:

1. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling that accounts for failures in any of the integrated APIs
2. **Transactional Integrity**: Consider how to maintain consistency when operations span multiple services
3. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize API calls by batching operations where possible
4. **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of API rate limits, especially when making many cross-service calls
5. **Authentication Scopes**: Ensure your authentication token has all necessary scopes for the APIs you're integrating
6. **Idempotent Operations**: Design integrations to be safely retryable in case of failures
