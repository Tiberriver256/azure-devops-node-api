# Integration Patterns Documentation

**Navigation**: [Home](../../index.md) > [API Reference](../index.md) > Integration Patterns

## Overview

Integration Patterns provide guidance on how to effectively combine multiple Azure DevOps APIs to solve common real-world scenarios. While individual API documentation focuses on specific methods and their usage, integration patterns demonstrate how these APIs work together to create comprehensive solutions.

## Purpose

The Integration Patterns documentation is designed to:

- Demonstrate practical, real-world usage scenarios that span multiple APIs
- Provide end-to-end code examples for common integration workflows
- Illustrate best practices for combining different Azure DevOps services
- Help developers understand the relationships between different APIs
- Accelerate development by offering reusable patterns for common tasks

## What's Included

This documentation covers key integration patterns between the most commonly used Azure DevOps APIs:

- [Work Item + Git Integration](./work-item-git-integration.md) - Patterns for integrating work item tracking with source control
- [Work Item + Build Integration](./work-item-build-integration.md) - Patterns for connecting work items with build pipelines
- [Git + Build Integration](./git-build-integration.md) - Patterns for automating builds based on repository events
- [Cross-API Examples](./cross-api-examples.md) - Complex scenarios involving three or more APIs

## Common Integration Scenarios

Integration patterns address several common scenarios in Azure DevOps workflows:

- **Traceability**: Linking work items to code changes, builds, and releases
- **Automation**: Triggering actions in one service based on events in another
- **Reporting**: Gathering data across multiple services for comprehensive reporting
- **Synchronization**: Keeping information consistent across different systems
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinating complex processes across multiple services

## Prerequisites

To use these integration patterns, you'll need:

- An Azure DevOps account with appropriate permissions
- A personal access token (PAT) with scopes for all relevant services
- The Azure DevOps Node.js API client library
- Familiarity with the individual APIs being integrated

## Getting Started

To implement these integration patterns, first establish a connection to your Azure DevOps organization and obtain the necessary API clients:

```typescript
import * as azdev from "azure-devops-node-api";

// Connection setup
const orgUrl = "https://dev.azure.com/yourorganization";
const token = "your-personal-access-token";

const authHandler = azdev.getPersonalAccessTokenHandler(token);
const connection = new azdev.WebApi(orgUrl, authHandler);

// Get API clients for integration
const witApi = await connection.getWorkItemTrackingApi();
const gitApi = await connection.getGitApi();
const buildApi = await connection.getBuildApi();

// Now you can implement the integration patterns
// using these API clients together
```

## Best Practices for API Integration

When implementing integration patterns, consider these best practices:

1. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling that accounts for failures in any of the integrated APIs
2. **Transactional Integrity**: Consider how to maintain consistency when operations span multiple services
3. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize API calls by batching operations where possible
4. **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of API rate limits, especially when making many cross-service calls
5. **Authentication Scopes**: Ensure your authentication token has all necessary scopes for the APIs you're integrating
6. **Idempotent Operations**: Design integrations to be safely retryable in case of failures
