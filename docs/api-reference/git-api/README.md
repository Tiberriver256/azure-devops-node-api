## Overview

The Azure DevOps Git API provides a comprehensive set of methods for interacting with Git repositories in Azure DevOps. It enables developers to programmatically manage repositories, branches, commits, pull requests, and more. This documentation provides detailed information about the most commonly used methods in the Git API.

## Purpose

The Git API is designed to facilitate:

### Repository Management
- Creating new repositories
- Updating repository settings
- Querying repository information
- Managing repository permissions

### Branch and Reference Operations
- Creating and deleting branches
- Managing tags and other references
- Setting branch policies
- Retrieving branch statistics

### Pull Request Workflows
- Creating new pull requests
- Reviewing and commenting on code
- Approving and completing pull requests
- Managing pull request policies

### Commit Operations
- Retrieving commit history
- Analyzing commit details
- Creating and pushing commits
- Managing commit comments

### File and Content Operations
- Retrieving file contents
- Analyzing and modifying code
- Managing file history
- Handling binary files

## Common Use Cases

The Git API is frequently used for:

### CI/CD Integration
Build automation systems that respond to repository events and trigger appropriate workflows.

### Custom Dashboards
Create specialized dashboards that display repository metrics, pull request status, and code quality information.

### Code Quality Automation
Implement automated code reviews and quality checks that run when code is pushed or pull requests are created.

### Policy Enforcement
Ensure branch policies are consistently applied and monitor compliance across repositories.

### Repository Analytics
Generate statistics and insights about repository activity, contributor patterns, and code changes.

### Workflow Automation
Automate pull request creation, branch management, and other Git workflows to improve team efficiency.

### Code Navigation
Build tools that help developers search, navigate, and understand code across repositories.

### Migration Tools
Create utilities for migrating repositories, branches, and history between systems.

## What's Included

This documentation covers:

- [Top 5 Git API Methods](./top-5-methods.md) - Detailed documentation of the most commonly used Git API methods
- [Code Examples](./code-examples.md) - Practical examples showing how to use the Git API
- [Common Errors](./common-errors.md) - Troubleshooting information for common Git API errors

## Prerequisites

To use the Git API, you'll need:

- An Azure DevOps account with appropriate permissions
- A Personal Access Token (PAT) or other authentication method
- The Azure DevOps Node.js API client library

## Getting Started

To start using the Git API, first establish a connection to your Azure DevOps organization:

```typescript
import * as azdev from "azure-devops-node-api";

// Connection setup
const orgUrl = "https://dev.azure.com/yourorganization";
const token = "your-personal-access-token";

const authHandler = azdev.getPersonalAccessTokenHandler(token);
const connection = new azdev.WebApi(orgUrl, authHandler);

// Get Git API client
const gitApi = await connection.getGitApi();

// Now you can use the Git API methods
// Example: Get all repositories
const repositories = await gitApi.getRepositories();
console.log(`Found ${repositories.length} repositories`);
```

## Integration with Other APIs

The Git API is commonly used in conjunction with other Azure DevOps APIs to create comprehensive solutions:

### Git + Work Item Integration

Git repositories, commits, and pull requests can be linked to work items to provide traceability between code changes and requirements. 

Common integration patterns include:

- Linking pull requests to work items
- Creating branches based on work item information
- Updating work item status based on pull request status

See [Work Item + Git Integration](../integration-patterns/work-item-git-integration.md) for detailed examples.

### Git + Build Integration

Git repositories and branches can trigger builds and deployments. 

Common integration patterns include:

- Triggering builds on commit or pull request
- Building specific branches
- Reporting build status on pull requests

See [Git + Build Integration](../integration-patterns/git-build-integration.md) for detailed examples.

### Cross-API Examples

For complex scenarios involving Git, Work Item Tracking, and Build APIs together, see [Cross-API Examples](../integration-patterns/cross-api-examples.md).
