# API Priority Matrix

## Purpose

This directory contains the API Priority Matrix for the Azure DevOps Node API. The API Priority Matrix is a strategic documentation tool that:

1. **Identifies Priority Methods**: Lists the most important methods within each API client
2. **Provides Use Cases**: Documents common use cases for each high-priority method
3. **Guides Documentation Efforts**: Determines which methods should be documented first and in most detail
4. **Helps New Developers**: Focuses learning efforts on the most impactful functionality

## Contents

- [API Priority Matrix](./api-priority-matrix.md) - Comprehensive matrix of prioritized methods across all API clients

## How to Use This Matrix

### For Documentation Team

- Use the prioritization to determine which methods to document first
- Focus detailed examples on the top methods from each client
- Ensure higher-priority methods have more comprehensive documentation
- Reference the common use cases when creating examples

### For Developers

- Start by learning the top-priority methods for your area of interest
- Use the provided examples as starting points for your own code
- Understand the most common integration patterns
- When migrating from older APIs, focus on migrating the high-priority methods first

### For Project Managers

- Use the matrix to plan integration efforts, focusing on high-value methods
- Estimate complexity based on the included complexity ratings
- Understand the common workflows enabled by each API client
- Plan training and skill development around the priority methods

## Methodology

The API Priority Matrix was created based on:

1. **Usage Analytics**: Analysis of API call patterns from Azure DevOps telemetry
2. **Developer Feedback**: Input from the Azure DevOps API team and community
3. **Support Tickets**: Frequency of support requests related to specific methods
4. **Ecosystem Impact**: Assessment of each method's importance to DevOps workflows
5. **Logical Progression**: Natural learning flow from basic to advanced functionality

The matrix is maintained by the documentation team with regular input from the development team to ensure it reflects current usage patterns and priorities.

## Updates

The API Priority Matrix will be reviewed and updated:

- When major new API versions are released
- When usage patterns significantly change
- At least once every six months
