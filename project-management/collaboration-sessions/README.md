# Collaboration Sessions

This directory contains records of collaboration sessions between team members working on the Azure DevOps Node API documentation project.

## Purpose

Documentation is a collaborative effort that benefits from diverse perspectives. These records serve to:

1. Document discussions and decisions made during collaboration sessions
2. Capture input from specialists across different disciplines
3. Provide context for decisions that influence documentation templates and standards
4. Serve as a knowledge base for future team members

## Contents

Each file in this directory represents a documented collaboration session, following this naming convention:

`[participant1]-[participant2]-[topic]-session.md`

For example:
- `taylor-jamie-tutorial-ux-session.md` - A session between Taylor (tech writer) and Jamie (UX lead) about tutorial design

## Session Records Format

Each session record should include:

- **Date and Time**: When the session occurred
- **Participants**: Who was involved (names and roles)
- **Topic**: The main focus of the discussion
- **Key Discussion Points**: Major topics covered
- **Decisions**: What was decided
