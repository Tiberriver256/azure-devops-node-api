# Template Structure Review Session

**Date**: [Current Date]
**Participants**: Taylor (Senior Technical Writer), Jamie (UI/UX Lead), Morgan (Documentation Project Manager)
**Topic**: Evaluating the templates directory structure and potential redundancies

## Meeting Notes

### Opening Discussion

**Morgan**: Thank you all for joining today. We need to review our documentation templates structure. Now that we have the comprehensive API reference template, we should evaluate whether we still need the separate api-method-template, class-template, and interface-template folders. I'm concerned about potential confusion and maintenance overhead with overlapping templates.

**Taylor**: That's a valid concern. Let's start by reviewing what each template was designed for and then discuss potential consolidation.

### Current Template Structure

**Taylor**: Currently, we have the following template types:
1. **API Reference Template** - A comprehensive multi-file template for complex API components
2. **API Method Template** - A single-file template for individual API methods
3. **Class Template** - A single-file template for documenting classes
4. **Interface Template** - A single-file template for documenting interfaces
5. **Tutorial Template** - A multi-file template for step-by-step guides

### Use Cases Analysis

**Taylor**: The API reference template was designed specifically for complex components that require a split view approach. It's most suitable for API components with many methods, complex data structures, and high usage frequency.

**Jamie**: From a user experience perspective, the API reference template provides excellent navigation for complex components, but it might be overkill for simpler components. We should consider the cognitive load for both readers and writers of the documentation.

**Morgan**: So the question is: do we still need the individual templates for simpler documentation cases?

**Taylor**: I believe we do. The API reference template is designed for complex components that benefit from the split view approach. For simpler components, the individual templates are more straightforward and require less overhead.

**Jamie**: I agree. From a UX perspective, forcing writers to use the split view approach for every component would create unnecessary complexity for simpler components. Having options allows documentation to match the complexity of what's being documented.

### Template Selection Criteria

**Morgan**: Let's establish clear criteria for when to use each template type.

**Taylor**: I propose the following criteria:
- Use the **API Reference Template** when:
  - The component has 15+ methods
  - The component has complex data structures
  - The component is frequently used
  - The component generates many support inquiries

- Use the **API Method Template** when:
  - Documenting a single method that doesn't belong to a complex component
  - Creating standalone method documentation
  
- Use the **Class Template** when:
  - Documenting a class with fewer than 15 methods
  - The class has a straightforward structure
  
- Use the **Interface Template** when:
  - Documenting a TypeScript interface
  - The interface is not part of a complex component

**Jamie**: That makes sense from a user experience perspective. We should also consider adding visual indicators in the documentation to help users navigate between simple and complex components.

### Potential Improvements

**Morgan**: Even if we keep all templates, are there improvements we can make to reduce confusion?

**Jamie**: We could create a clearer template selection guide that helps writers choose the appropriate template. Perhaps a decision tree or flowchart.

**Taylor**: We should also ensure consistent navigation patterns across all templates. Even though they have different structures, the navigation principles should be consistent.

**Morgan**: What about standardizing certain elements across all templates? For example, ensuring that "Parameters" sections look identical regardless of which template is used.

**Taylor**: That's a great idea. We could create a shared components directory with standardized sections that all templates can include.

### Recommendations

**Morgan**: Based on our discussion, what are our recommendations?

**Taylor**: I recommend:
1. Keep all current template types
2. Create a clearer template selection guide with specific criteria
3. Standardize common sections across all templates
4. Create a shared components directory for reusable template sections
5. Ensure consistent navigation patterns across all templates
6. Update the README to reflect these changes and clarify when to use each template

**Jamie**: I'd also add:
1. Add visual indicators to help users understand the structure they're navigating
2. Consider creating a template complexity rating (similar to our method complexity rating)
3. Ensure mobile-friendly navigation for all template types

**Morgan**: Those are excellent recommendations. Taylor, could you implement these changes? I'd particularly like to see updates to the main templates README to clarify when to use each template.

**Taylor**: Yes, I'll implement these changes. I'll start with updating the README and creating a more comprehensive template selection guide.

### Conclusion

**Morgan**: Thank you both for your insights. It seems we agree that keeping all templates serves different documentation needs, but we should improve their organization and selection criteria. Taylor will implement the recommended changes, and we'll review them in our next session.

**Action Items**:
1. Taylor will update the templates README with clearer selection criteria
2. Taylor will create a shared components directory for standardized sections
3. Taylor will ensure consistent navigation patterns across all templates
4. Jamie will provide design input for visual indicators and mobile navigation
5. Team will review the changes in the next meeting
