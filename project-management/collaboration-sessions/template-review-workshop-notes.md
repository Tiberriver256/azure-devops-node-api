# Template Review Workshop Notes

**Date:** July 15, 2024  
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 4:15 PM  
**Location:** Conference Room A  
**Participants:** Taylor (Senior Technical Writer), Jordan (UI/UX Specialist), Casey (Developer Advocate), Morgan (Documentation Project Manager)  
**Topic:** Comprehensive Review of Documentation Templates

## Workshop Summary

The workshop successfully reviewed all documentation templates created for the Azure DevOps Node API documentation. Jordan and Casey provided valuable feedback from UX and developer perspectives, resulting in several actionable improvements and a clear path forward for implementation.

## Key Discussion Points

### Introduction and Context

- Taylor presented an overview of the documentation standards progress, highlighting the comprehensive template package developed over the past weeks
- Morgan emphasized the importance of this review as a critical milestone before beginning implementation across API clients
- Jordan and Casey shared their initial impressions after reviewing the pre-workshop materials

### Template Review Sessions

#### API Reference Templates

**Strengths identified:**
- Split-view approach for complex components effectively addresses cognitive load concerns
- Method categorization in complex components improves navigation
- Consistent structure across different template types
- Comprehensive parameter and return type documentation

**Improvement opportunities:**
- **Jordan suggested:** Adding visual indicators for method complexity/importance
- **Casey suggested:** Enhancing error handling sections with more specific examples
- **Both agreed:** Navigation between related methods could be more intuitive

**Key decisions:**
- Implement visual indicators for method complexity using emoji or simple text markers
- Expand error handling sections with specific error codes and examples
- Create a more robust cross-reference system between related methods

#### Tutorial & Conceptual Templates

**Strengths identified:**
- Progressive disclosure approach works well for complex topics
- Multi-file structure improves readability and focus
- Clear prerequisites and next steps sections
- Comprehensive troubleshooting sections

**Improvement opportunities:**
- **Jordan suggested:** Adding estimated completion time for tutorials
- **Casey suggested:** More code snippets showing common errors and their solutions
- **Both agreed:** Visual progress indicators would improve user experience

**Key decisions:**
- Add time estimates for each tutorial section
- Implement a "common pitfalls" section in each tutorial
- Create a standard visual progress indicator compatible with GitHub markdown

#### Troubleshooting Guide Template

**Strengths identified:**
- Comprehensive structure with progressive disclosure
- Severity and time indicators provide valuable context
- Decision tree approach helps users navigate to solutions
- Diagnostic tools section is particularly valuable

**Improvement opportunities:**
- **Jordan suggested:** More visual separation between different severity levels
- **Casey suggested:** Adding more specific code examples for diagnostic tools
- **Both agreed:** The template could benefit from a "quick fix" summary at the top

**Key decisions:**
- Enhance visual distinction between severity levels
- Expand diagnostic tools with more code examples
- Add a "quick fix" summary section at the top of each problem category

### Template Selection Guide Review

**Feedback on selection criteria:**
- Selection criteria are clear and comprehensive
- Examples effectively illustrate when to use each template
- Decision tree is logical and covers most common scenarios

**Improvement suggestions:**
- **Jordan suggested:** Adding visual flowchart representation of the decision tree
- **Casey suggested:** Including more specific examples of edge cases
- **Both agreed:** A comparison table showing template features would be helpful

**Key decisions:**
- Create a visual flowchart as a static image for the decision tree
- Add edge case examples to the detailed selection criteria
- Develop a feature comparison table for all template types

### Implementation Planning

**Prioritization discussion:**
- Casey recommended prioritizing the Work Item Tracking API and Git API documentation as they are most commonly used
- Jordan suggested starting with a smaller API client to test the templates before tackling complex ones
- Morgan proposed a phased approach, starting with one complex and one simple API client

**Resource requirements:**
- Estimated 2-3 days per API client for documentation using the templates
- Additional time needed for complex clients using the split-view approach
- Technical review time from API specialists for each client

**Maintenance strategy:**
- Quarterly reviews of templates based on user feedback
- GitHub issue templates for template-specific feedback
- Documentation update process tied to API version releases

## Action Items

1. **Template Enhancements:**
   - Taylor to implement visual indicators for method complexity (Due: July 22)
   - Taylor to expand error handling sections with specific examples (Due: July 25)
   - Taylor to add time estimates to tutorial sections (Due: July 22)
   - Taylor to enhance visual distinction between severity levels in troubleshooting guides (Due: July 24)

2. **Selection Guide Improvements:**
   - Jordan to create visual flowchart for decision tree (Due: July 29)
   - Casey to provide edge case examples for selection criteria (Due: July 27)
   - Taylor to develop feature comparison table (Due: July 31)

3. **Implementation Planning:**
   - Morgan to finalize prioritization of API clients (Due: July 20)
   - Taylor to create implementation schedule (Due: July 25)
   - Casey to identify key technical reviewers for each API client (Due: July 27)

4. **Next Steps:**
   - Schedule follow-up meeting to review template enhancements (August 1)
   - Begin documentation of first API client using finalized templates (August 5)
   - Set up feedback collection mechanism for templates (July 31)

## Participant Feedback

### Jordan (UI/UX Specialist)
"The templates show a thoughtful approach to documentation structure. The split-view approach for complex components is particularly impressive. I'm excited to see how the visual enhancements we discussed will further improve the user experience."

### Casey (Developer Advocate)
"From a developer perspective, these templates address many of the pain points I've seen in API documentation. The troubleshooting guide template is especially valuable. With the enhancements we discussed, these templates will provide an excellent foundation for our documentation."

### Morgan (Documentation Project Manager)
"This workshop has been incredibly productive. The feedback from Jordan and Casey will help us refine these templates before full implementation. I'm confident we're on the right track to create documentation that truly serves our users' needs."

## Next Meeting
