**Subject:** Tutorial Template Restructuring - Multi-File Approach

## Implementation of Your Feedback

Hi Jamie,

Thank you for your valuable feedback about the tutorial template being too large and complex for users. I've implemented your suggestion by restructuring the tutorial template into a multi-file format that aligns with the progressive disclosure pattern we discussed in our collaboration session.

## New Multi-File Structure

I've created a new directory structure for tutorials:

```
tutorial-name/
├── index.md                      # Main entry point with navigation
└── sections/
    ├── 01-header-overview.md     # Title, badges, introduction, and overview
    ├── 02-prerequisites.md       # Required software, accounts, and knowledge
    ├── 03-basic-implementation.md # Step-by-step guide for minimal example
    ├── 04-advanced-features.md   # Additional functionality
    ├── 05-common-scenarios.md    # Real-world use cases
    ├── 06-complete-example.md    # Full code example
    ├── 07-troubleshooting.md     # Common issues and solutions
    └── 08-next-steps-resources.md # Related documentation and further learning
```

## Key Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Users can focus on one section at a time without being overwhelmed by a massive document
2. **Improved Navigation**: Clear navigation links between sections help users move through the tutorial in a logical sequence
3. **Better Maintainability**: Writers can update individual sections without navigating a large file
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is presented in a logical sequence, starting with the basics and progressively adding complexity
5. **Modular Reuse**: Sections can be reused or referenced across different tutorials

## Navigation System

Each section includes a consistent navigation footer:

```
---

**Navigation**:
- [Back to Index](../index.md)
- Previous: [Previous Section](./previous-section.md)
- Next: [Next Section](./next-section.md)
```

This helps users maintain context while moving through the tutorial.

## Documentation Updates

I've also:
1. Updated the Tutorial Template Guide to include instructions for using the multi-file structure
2. Created a README file explaining the purpose and benefits of the multi-file approach
3. Updated my task tracking to reflect this implementation

## Next Steps

I'd appreciate your review of this new structure to ensure it meets your UX requirements. I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on:

1. Is the navigation system intuitive enough?
2. Does the section breakdown make sense from a user perspective?
3. Are there any additional improvements we should consider?

I've scheduled time for us to review this together next Tuesday at 2:00 PM if that works for you.

Thank you again for your feedback. This restructuring will significantly improve the usability of our tutorial documentation.

Best regards,
Taylor
