# Meeting Notes: Taylor & Jamie - Template Review Feedback Discussion

**Date:** July 20, 2024  
**Time:** 10:00 AM - 11:15 AM  
**Participants:** Taylor (Senior Technical Writer), Jamie (UX/Design Specialist)  
**Topic:** Refining Template Review Feedback Within Technical Constraints

## Meeting Summary

Taylor and Jamie met to discuss the feedback from the template review workshop with Jordan and Casey, focusing on how to implement the UX-related suggestions within the constraints of GitHub-hosted markdown documentation. They identified practical solutions that balance improved user experience with technical limitations and maintainability concerns.

## Discussion Points

### Technical Constraints Review

**Taylor:** "I reviewed the feedback from Jordan and Casey, and while their suggestions are excellent, some seem to conflict with our technical constraints. We're limited to GitHub-flavored markdown without custom HTML/CSS or JavaScript."

**Jamie:** "Yes, that's a significant constraint. Let's go through the key UX suggestions and see how we can adapt them to work within GitHub's limitations while still improving the documentation experience."

**Taylor:** "We also need to consider maintainability and our timeline. We need solutions that are practical to implement across all templates and won't create excessive maintenance overhead."

### Visual Hierarchy & Navigation Improvements

**Jamie:** "For visual hierarchy, we're limited without CSS, but we can still use GitHub's native markdown features strategically. For example:"

1. **Consistent Header Levels**: Using header levels consistently creates a natural visual hierarchy
2. **Strategic Whitespace**: Adding blank lines between sections creates visual separation
3. **Emojis as Visual Anchors**: Using emojis consistently for different content types (üìã for prerequisites, üîç for examples, etc.)
4. **Blockquotes for Emphasis**: Using blockquotes (`>`) to highlight important information

**Taylor:** "Those are good approaches. What about the navigation improvements?"

**Jamie:** "For navigation, we can implement:"

1. **Consistent Breadcrumbs**: Using a simple text-based breadcrumb at the top of each document
   ```
   **Navigation**: [Home](../index.md) > [API Reference](./index.md) > WorkItemTrackingApi
   ```

2. **Table of Contents**: Adding a linked table of contents at the top of longer documents using GitHub's auto-generated heading anchors
   ```
   - [Overview](#overview)
   - [Methods](#methods)
   - [Examples](#examples)
   ```

3. **See Also Sections**: Adding a consistent "See Also" section at the end of each document with related links

**Taylor:** "These solutions work within our constraints. What about the method importance indicators and progress indicators for tutorials?"

### Method Importance & Progress Indicators

**Jamie:** "For method importance, we can use simple emoji indicators that won't require custom styling:"

```
‚≠ê getWorkItems - Commonly used method for retrieving work items
üîÑ updateWorkItem - Core method for modifying work items
üÜï createWorkItem - Essential method for creating work items
```

**Jamie:** "For tutorial progress, we can create a simple text-based indicator that works in GitHub markdown:"

```
**Progress**: [‚úì] Setup ‚Üí [‚úì] Authentication ‚Üí [‚úì] Configuration ‚Üí [ ] Implementation ‚Üí [ ] Testing
```

**Taylor:** "That's simple but effective. What about the time estimates for tutorials?"

**Jamie:** "We can add time estimates using emoji and consistent formatting:"

```
## Step 2: Create a connection to Azure DevOps (‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes)
```

### Troubleshooting Guide Enhancements

**Taylor:** "Jordan suggested more visual separation between severity levels in the troubleshooting guide. How can we achieve that with our constraints?"

**Jamie:** "We can use horizontal rules (`---`) between issues of different severities, and make the severity indicators more prominent:"

```
## High Severity Issues

### Authentication Failure
üî¥ **High Severity** | ‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes

[Issue details...]

---

## Medium Severity Issues

### Rate Limiting
üü° **Medium Severity** | ‚è±Ô∏è 10 minutes

[Issue details...]
```

**Taylor:** "That works. What about the quick fix summary section?"

**Jamie:** "We can use GitHub's collapsible sections for that:"

```
<details>
<summary><b>Quick Fix Summary</b></summary>

- üî¥ Authentication Failure: Regenerate your PAT token
- üü° Rate Limiting: Implement exponential backoff
- üü¢ Missing Parameters: Check required parameters documentation

</details>
```

### Template Selection Guide Improvements

**Taylor:** "Casey and Jordan suggested a visual flowchart for the decision tree, but we can't embed interactive diagrams in GitHub markdown."

**Jamie:** "We can create a static flowchart image using a tool like draw.io, export it as PNG, and include it in the repository. It won't be interactive, but it will provide the visual guidance they're looking for."

**Taylor:** "Good idea. And for the feature comparison table?"

**Jamie:** "We can create a comprehensive markdown table that shows which elements are included in each template type:"

```
| Feature | API Reference | Method | Class | Interface | Tutorial | Conceptual | Troubleshooting |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Method List | ‚úì | - | ‚úì | ‚úì | - | - | - |
| Parameters | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | - | - | - |
| Examples | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| ...     | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

## Practical Implementation Plan

**Taylor:** "These are all workable solutions within our constraints. Let's prioritize them based on impact and implementation effort."

**Jamie:** "I agree. Here's how I'd prioritize:"

### High Priority (Implement First)
1. Consistent breadcrumb navigation
2. Method importance indicators
3. Time estimates for tutorials
4. Quick fix summary for troubleshooting guides
5. Visual separation in troubleshooting guides

### Medium Priority
1. Table of contents for longer documents
2. Progress indicators for tutorials
3. Emojis as visual anchors
4. See Also sections

### Lower Priority (If Time Permits)
1. Static flowchart for decision tree
2. Feature comparison table
3. Edge case examples

**Taylor:** "That prioritization makes sense. Let's also consider how to standardize these elements to ensure consistency and maintainability."

**Jamie:** "Good point. We should create a 'Visual Elements Guide' that documents all these patterns and how to use them consistently. This will help ensure that all documentation follows the same patterns, even when created by different team members."

## Action Items

1. **Taylor to create:**
   - Draft of Visual Elements Guide with standardized patterns
   - Implementation examples for high-priority items
   - Updated templates incorporating the agreed-upon solutions

2. **Jamie to create:**
   - Static flowchart image for decision tree
   - Example progress indicator implementation
   - Visual anchor emoji reference guide

3. **Follow-up meeting:**
   - Review implementation examples
   - Finalize Visual Elements Guide
   - Plan integration into existing templates

## Conclusion

**Jamie:** "I think we've found practical solutions that will significantly improve the documentation experience while working within our technical constraints and maintainability requirements."

**Taylor:** "Agreed. These solutions address the core issues raised in the feedback while being realistic to implement. Let's meet with Morgan next to discuss these approaches and get approval before proceeding with implementation."
