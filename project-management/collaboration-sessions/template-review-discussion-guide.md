# Template Review Workshop Discussion Guide

This guide provides structured discussion points and activities to facilitate our template review workshop with Jordan and Casey. Use this to guide the conversation and ensure we cover all key topics.

## Pre-Workshop Preparation

Before the workshop, ensure all participants:
- Have reviewed the [Template Selection Guide](../documentation-standards/templates/template-selection-guide.md)
- Have examined the [Template Comparison Examples](./template-comparison-examples.md)
- Are familiar with the current template structure in `project-management/documentation-standards/templates/`

## Opening Discussion (15 minutes)

### Introduction Questions

1. **Current Documentation Challenges**
   - What are the biggest challenges you face when using or creating documentation?
   - What aspects of our current documentation are most confusing for users?
   - What documentation formats have you found most helpful in your own work?

2. **Template Usage Experience**
   - Have you used any of our current templates? If so, which ones?
   - What was your experience like? What worked well? What was challenging?
   - How intuitive was the template selection process?

## Template Review Activities (60 minutes)

### Activity 1: Template Evaluation (20 minutes)

For each template type, discuss:

1. **Structure and Organization**
   - Is the template structure logical and easy to follow?
   - Are sections ordered in a way that makes sense for the content type?
   - Is there a clear hierarchy of information?

2. **Content Completeness**
   - Does the template include all necessary sections?
   - Are there any redundant or unnecessary sections?
   - What additional sections might be valuable?

3. **Usability**
   - How easy would it be for a new team member to use this template?
   - Are the instructions and placeholders clear?
   - What might cause confusion or errors?

### Activity 2: Template Selection Scenarios (20 minutes)

Present the following scenarios and discuss which template would be most appropriate:

1. **Scenario 1: Complex API Client**
   - You need to document the `GitApi` client, which has 30+ methods organized into categories for repositories, pull requests, commits, and branches.
   - Which template would you choose and why?
   - How would you organize the documentation?

2. **Scenario 2: Authentication Helper**
   - You need to document the `getPersonalAccessTokenHandler` function, which is a standalone helper for authentication.
   - Which template would you choose and why?
   - What sections would be most important?

3. **Scenario 3: Error Handling**
   - Users are reporting confusion about error handling across the API.
   - Which template would be most appropriate for addressing this?
   - How would you structure the content?

4. **Scenario 4: Getting Started**
   - New users need guidance on setting up and making their first API call.
   - Which template would you choose and why?
   - What content would be essential to include?

### Activity 3: Template Improvement Workshop (20 minutes)

For each template type, identify:

1. **Top Strengths**
   - What works particularly well in this template?
   - What should definitely be preserved?

2. **Top Improvement Opportunities**
   - What could be improved or clarified?
   - What's missing or could be enhanced?

3. **Standardization Opportunities**
   - What elements should be consistent across all templates?
   - What customizations should be allowed for each template type?

## Template Selection Guide Review (20 minutes)

Review the [Template Selection Guide](../documentation-standards/templates/template-selection-guide.md) and discuss:

1. **Selection Criteria**
   - Are the criteria for selecting each template clear and comprehensive?
   - Do the examples help illustrate when to use each template?
   - What additional guidance would be helpful?

2. **Decision Tree**
   - Is the decision tree logical and easy to follow?
   - Does it cover all common documentation scenarios?
   - How could it be improved?

3. **Quick Selection Guide**
   - Is the quick selection table helpful?
   - What additional information would make selection easier?

## Implementation Planning (20 minutes)

Discuss the implementation strategy for the templates:

1. **Prioritization**
   - Which API components should be documented first?
   - What criteria should we use for prioritization?

2. **Timeline and Resources**
   - What's a realistic timeline for implementing these templates?
   - What resources will be needed?
   - How can we distribute the documentation work effectively?

3. **Maintenance Strategy**
   - How will we ensure templates stay up-to-date?
   - What process should we use for template revisions?
   - How will we handle feedback on the templates?

## Closing Discussion (15 minutes)

1. **Key Takeaways**
   - What are the most important insights from today's discussion?
   - What decisions have we made about the templates?
   - What questions remain unresolved?

2. **Next Steps**
   - What immediate actions should we take?
   - Who will be responsible for each action item?
   - When should we reconvene to review progress?

## Workshop Facilitation Tips

- Encourage all participants to contribute
- Use timeboxing to keep discussions focused
- Capture action items and decisions in real-time
- Use visual aids when discussing template examples
- Take breaks between major activities
- Summarize key points before moving to the next topic

## Post-Workshop Follow-Up

After the workshop:
1. Distribute meeting notes within 24 hours
2. Create tasks for agreed-upon template improvements
3. Schedule follow-up meetings for unresolved questions
4. Set up a feedback mechanism for template users
5. Establish a timeline for template implementation
