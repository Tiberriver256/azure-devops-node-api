# Taylor & Jessie Collaboration Session: Breaking Down the Troubleshooting Guide Template

**Date:** June 17, 2023  
**Time:** 10:30 AM - 11:45 AM  
**Participants:** Taylor (Senior Technical Writer), Jessie (Documentation UX Specialist)  
**Topic:** Restructuring the Troubleshooting Guide Template into a Multi-File Format  

## Meeting Notes

### Introduction

**Taylor:** Thanks for meeting with me today, Jessie. I've been working on the troubleshooting guide template, and I'm finding that it's becoming quite large and potentially overwhelming for both writers and users. I remembered how successful the multi-file approach was for our tutorial template after implementing your suggestions, so I thought we could discuss applying a similar structure to the troubleshooting guide.

**Jessie:** Absolutely, Taylor. I just reviewed the current troubleshooting template, and I agree it's getting unwieldy. When I look at troubleshooting guides from a UX perspective, I see them as decision trees where users are trying to follow a path to their specific problem rather than reading the entire document. A multi-file approach could definitely help with that navigation challenge.

### Current Structure Assessment

**Taylor:** Right now, the troubleshooting guide is a single markdown file with sections for quick solutions, issue identification, common problems grouped by category, error code references, advanced troubleshooting, and a decision tree. It's getting to be over 400 lines, and I'm concerned it will be hard to maintain and navigate.

**Jessie:** I see what you mean. Looking at our analytics, most users who access troubleshooting guides are already experiencing an issue and want to get to their specific solution as quickly as possible. They rarely read through the entire document. A multi-file approach could help them navigate directly to the relevant section.

**Taylor:** Exactly. The challenge is figuring out how to break it down while maintaining a coherent structure that doesn't lose the relationships between different issues and their solutions.

### Multi-File Structure Proposal

**Jessie:** Based on our success with the tutorial template, I think we could use a similar index-based approach. Let me sketch out a potential structure:

```
troubleshooting-guide-template/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                      # Overview of template usage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md                       # Main entry point with issue categories & navigation 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quick-solutions.md             # Common issues and quick fixes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sections/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ issue-identification.md    # Symptoms, error messages, diagnostic tools
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ problem-categories/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ category1-problems.md  # E.g., authentication-issues.md 
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ category2-problems.md  # E.g., connection-problems.md
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ category3-problems.md  # E.g., data-retrieval-issues.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ error-code-reference.md    # Complete error code table
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ advanced-troubleshooting.md # Complex diagnostic techniques
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decision-tree.md           # Visual troubleshooting flowchart
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ getting-help.md            # How to proceed if guide doesn't solve the issue
```

**Taylor:** I like that approach. It would allow us to maintain separate files for each problem category, which would be more manageable for both writers and users. The index could serve as a diagnostic entry point, helping users navigate to the right section.

**Jessie:** Exactly. And we could optimize each file for its specific purpose. For example, the quick-solutions.md could be very concise and focused on immediate remedies, while the category-specific files could go into more depth on specific issues.

### User Navigation Considerations

**Taylor:** How would users navigate between these files? I'm worried about them getting lost if they have to keep going back to the index.

**Jessie:** Good point. I recommend we implement consistent navigation patterns at the top and bottom of each file:

1. Breadcrumb navigation at the top showing where they are in the structure
2. "Next" and "Previous" links at the bottom for sequential navigation
3. A "Related Issues" section at the end of each problem page
4. An "In This Category" mini-table of contents in each category file

**Taylor:** That makes sense. We should also keep the diagnostic checklist and decision tree accessible from every page, since those are key entry points for users trying to identify their specific issue.

**Jessie:** Absolutely. The decision tree is especially important‚Äîit's essentially a visual navigation aid. We could place a simplified version in the index file with links to specific sections, and then have more detailed decision trees within each category file.

### Implementation Details

**Taylor:** For the problem categories, should we pre-define these or leave them flexible for writers to determine based on the specific API component?

**Jessie:** I think we should provide a set of recommended categories with clear guidelines, but allow flexibility. From our analytics on support tickets, these categories tend to cover most issues across API products:

1. Authentication Issues
2. Connection Problems
3. Permission/Authorization Errors
4. Data Retrieval Issues
5. Data Modification Errors
6. Rate Limiting and Performance
7. Configuration Problems

**Taylor:** That's helpful. I'll include these as recommended categories in the template guide.

**Jessie:** For each problem file, I also recommend a consistent structure:

```markdown
# [Problem Name]

> **Applies to:** [API versions, components]

## Symptoms
[How to recognize this issue]

## Root Causes
[Why this happens]

## Solution Steps
[Step-by-step resolution]

## Prevention
[How to avoid this in the future]

## Related Issues
[Links to related problems]
```

**Taylor:** I like this structure. It's concise but covers everything a user needs to know about a specific issue.

### Navigation Optimization

**Jessie:** Another consideration is that users often arrive at troubleshooting guides from search engines with specific error messages. We should ensure that error messages are prominently displayed in headings or at the beginning of sections so search engines can index them effectively.

**Taylor:** Good point. We should also ensure that each file has a descriptive title that includes common search terms related to the issues it addresses.

**Jessie:** Exactly. And since we're limited to GitHub-compatible markdown, we should make heavy use of anchor links within the files to create jump-to sections for specific errors or scenarios.

### Interactive Elements within GitHub Constraints

**Taylor:** Since we're limited to GitHub-hosted markdown, what interactive elements can we use to improve the user experience?

**Jessie:** While GitHub does have limitations, we can still use:

1. Collapsible sections with `<details>` tags for code examples and verbose explanations
2. Emoji indicators for different types of issues (üîí for authentication, üåê for network, etc.)
3. Checkbox lists for step-by-step verification procedures
4. Code blocks with syntax highlighting for error messages and solutions
5. Tables for comparing different scenarios or error types

**Taylor:** That's great. I'll incorporate these elements into the template.

### Example Implementation

**Taylor:** Would it make sense for us to create a concrete example implementation to help writers understand how to use this template?

**Jessie:** Definitely. I suggest we create an "Authentication Troubleshooting Guide" as our example, since authentication issues are common across all API components and would demonstrate the multi-file approach well.

**Taylor:** That's a great idea. I'll work on that example implementation to include with the template.

### Action Items

1. **Taylor:** Restructure the troubleshooting template into the proposed multi-file format
2. **Taylor:** Create implementation guidelines for the new template structure
3. **Taylor:** Develop the "Authentication Troubleshooting Guide" example
4. **Jessie:** Develop navigation patterns for the multi-file structure
5. **Jessie:** Create a simplified decision tree format that works well in GitHub markdown
6. **Both:** Review the restructured template in a follow-up session next week

### Conclusion

**Taylor:** This has been extremely helpful, Jessie. I'm excited about implementing this multi-file approach for the troubleshooting guide. I think it will make the template much more usable for writers and result in more effective guides for our users.

**Jessie:** Happy to help! The best documentation is the one users can navigate easily to find exactly what they need. This structure should help accomplish that for troubleshooting guides. Let's check in next week after you've had a chance to implement these changes.

**Taylor:** Sounds good. I'll schedule a follow-up session for next Wednesday to review the initial implementation.

## Next Steps

- Taylor to implement the multi-file structure for the troubleshooting guide template by June 22
- Jessie to review the implementation and provide feedback by June 26
- Follow-up meeting scheduled for June 28 to finalize the template
