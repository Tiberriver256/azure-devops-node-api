# Meeting Notes: Documentation Strategy Adjustment Due to Budget Constraints

**Date:** March 28, 2023  
**Time:** 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM  
**Location:** Conference Room A / Zoom Meeting ID: 987-654-321  
**Participants:** Morgan (Documentation Project Manager), Taylor (Senior Technical Writer), Jamie (UI/UX Lead)

## Meeting Objectives
- Discuss the budget constraints affecting our documentation hosting plans
- Adjust our documentation strategy to work within GitHub-hosted markdown files
- Brainstorm alternative approaches to achieve similar user experience goals
- Assign responsibilities for creating revised proposals

## Discussion Points

### 1. Budget Constraints Update

**Morgan:** I wanted to bring us together today because I've received word from leadership that we won't have budget for hosting these docs on a dedicated website as we had planned. This means we're restricted to using markdown files within the GitHub repository. This affects our expandable view proposal and some of the interactive elements we were planning.

**Taylor:** That's disappointing news. The expandable view would have significantly improved the user experience for complex API components.

**Jamie:** I understand the constraints. From a UX perspective, this is challenging, but I think we can still find ways to improve the documentation experience within the limitations of GitHub-hosted markdown.

**Morgan:** Exactly. I wanted us to put our heads together and figure out how we can adapt our plans while still addressing the core user needs we identified.

### 2. Impact Assessment

**Morgan:** Let's first identify what aspects of our proposals are affected by this constraint.

**Taylor:** The main impacts are:
1. No client-side JavaScript for the expandable view toggle
2. No interactive elements like collapsible code sections
3. No analytics tracking for user behavior
4. Limited styling options for visual indicators and navigation

**Jamie:** We also lose the ability to implement:
1. User preference storage
2. Dynamic content loading
3. Some of the more advanced accessibility features
4. Responsive design elements that require JavaScript

**Morgan:** That's a good summary. The core issue is that we lose the dynamic, interactive elements that would have made navigation easier for complex documentation.

### 3. Alternative Approaches

**Morgan:** Let's brainstorm alternatives that work within GitHub-hosted markdown files.

**Taylor:** One approach could be to create a "directory-based" version of the expandable view:
1. Maintain the single-file comprehensive documentation
2. Create a parallel directory structure with individual markdown files for each section
3. Add clear navigation links between the files
4. Provide a "navigation index" file that serves as a table of contents

**Jamie:** I like that approach. We could also:
1. Use GitHub's anchor links more strategically to help users navigate within large files
2. Create standardized "Quick Navigation" sections at the top of complex documentation
3. Implement a consistent visual structure using markdown formatting to help users scan content
4. Use collapsible sections with GitHub's `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML tags

**Morgan:** Those are excellent suggestions. What about addressing the cognitive load issue for complex API components?

**Taylor:** We could implement a "split view" approach:
1. Break very complex classes into logical sub-files (methods, properties, examples)
2. Create a main "overview" file that links to all the sub-files
3. Include "breadcrumb" style navigation at the top of each file
4. Add "Next/Previous" links at the bottom of each file

**Jamie:** For visual hierarchy, we could also:
1. Use emoji icons as visual indicators for different types of content
2. Create standardized "information cards" using blockquotes or tables
3. Implement consistent heading levels to create clear visual hierarchy
4. Use horizontal rules strategically to separate content sections

### 4. Revised Documentation Strategy

**Morgan:** Based on our discussion, I think we should pursue a hybrid approach:

1. **Standard Documentation (Most Components):**
   - Single markdown file for each API component
   - Enhanced internal navigation with anchor links
   - Standardized "Quick Navigation" section at the top
   - Consistent visual structure and formatting

2. **Complex Documentation (Selected Components):**
   - Main "overview" file with links to sub-files
   - Separate files for methods, properties, examples, etc.
   - Consistent navigation between files
   - "Breadcrumb" navigation at the top of each file

**Taylor:** That makes sense. We can still achieve many of our goals for improving user experience, just with a different implementation approach.

**Jamie:** I agree. While we lose some interactive elements, we can compensate with thoughtful organization and consistent visual patterns.

### 5. Next Steps and Action Items

**Morgan:** Let's outline our next steps:

1. **Taylor:**
   - Update the expandable view proposal to reflect the GitHub-only constraints
   - Create a new proposal for the "split view" approach for complex components
   - Develop a prototype for the WorkItemTrackingApi using the split view approach
   - Update the todo list to reflect these changes

2. **Jamie:**
   - Develop visual hierarchy guidelines for GitHub markdown
   - Create navigation patterns that work within markdown constraints
   - Review Taylor's prototype from a UX perspective
   - Document best practices for content organization in GitHub markdown

3. **Morgan:**
   - Communicate the strategy adjustment to stakeholders
   - Secure approval for the revised approach
   - Update the documentation roadmap
   - Schedule a follow-up meeting to review the prototype

**Timeline:**
- Updated proposals: By April 1, 2023
- WorkItemTrackingApi prototype: By April 5, 2023
- Review meeting: April 7, 2023, 10:00 AM

## Conclusion

**Morgan:** Despite the budget constraints, I think we've identified some promising approaches to improve the documentation experience. The core principles of reducing cognitive load and improving navigation remain the same, even if the implementation differs.

**Taylor:** I'm confident we can still create excellent documentation within these constraints. The split view approach should address many of the same issues we identified in our original proposal.

**Jamie:** From a UX perspective, consistency will be key. If we establish clear patterns for navigation and visual hierarchy, users will quickly learn how to navigate the documentation effectively.

**Morgan:** Great discussion, everyone. Let's move forward with these revised plans and reconvene next week to review the prototype.
