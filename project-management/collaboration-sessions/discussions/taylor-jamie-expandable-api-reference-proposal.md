# Follow-up: Expandable API Reference Proposal

**Date:** March 23, 2023  
**From:** Taylor (Senior Technical Writer)  
**To:** Jamie (UI/UX Lead)  
**Subject:** Proposal for Expandable View in Complex API Reference Documentation

Hi Jamie,

Following up on your excellent suggestion to explore applying our multi-file approach to complex API reference documentation, I've developed a comprehensive proposal that I'd like to share with you.

## Expandable View Concept

Rather than completely replacing our single-file API reference approach (which works well for searchability and context), I'm proposing an optional "Expandable View" for particularly complex components. This would give users the choice of how they want to consume the documentation based on their needs.

The key features include:

1. **Default Single-File View**: Maintains the comprehensive single-file approach for all API reference documentation
2. **Optional Expansion**: Adds a toggle option for complex components to expand into a multi-file view
3. **Logical Section Breakdown**: Divides complex documentation into logical sections (Overview, Properties, Methods, Examples, etc.)
4. **Consistent Navigation**: Implements the same navigation system we developed for the tutorial template
5. **Persistent Context**: Ensures users maintain context when navigating between expanded sections

## Selection Criteria

I'm proposing we apply this approach selectively to components that meet specific complexity thresholds:

- Classes/Interfaces with more than 15 methods or properties
- Methods with more than 10 parameters or complex return types
- Components with extensive examples or usage scenarios
- Components that frequently appear in user support inquiries

## Technical Implementation

I've outlined two potential implementation approaches:

**Option A: Client-Side Toggle (Preferred)**
- Maintain a single Markdown file for each component
- Use JavaScript to dynamically split and display content as separate "pages"
- Implement toggle controls to switch between single-file and expanded views
- Store user preference in browser local storage

**Option B: Separate File Generation**
- Generate both single-file and multi-file versions during the documentation build process
- Provide links to toggle between views
- Maintain a single source file to ensure content consistency

## User Interface Mockup

The toggle would be implemented as a prominent control at the top of complex component documentation:

```
[View as: (â€¢) Single Page | ( ) Expanded Sections]
```

When "Expanded Sections" is selected, the page would transform to show:

1. A table of contents for the component sections
2. The current section's content
3. Navigation controls to move between sections (similar to our tutorial template)

## Pilot Implementation

I'm proposing we implement this approach as a pilot for the `WorkItemTrackingApi` class, which is one of our most complex components with numerous methods, properties, and usage examples.

## Your Input

I'd love to get your thoughts on this proposal, particularly:

1. **User Experience**: Does the toggle approach provide a clear and intuitive way for users to choose their preferred documentation view?

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Does this approach effectively address the cognitive load concerns you raised while maintaining the benefits of comprehensive documentation?

3. **Visual Design**: Any suggestions for how the toggle and expanded view should be visually presented to maximize usability?

4. **Accessibility**: Any considerations we should keep in mind to ensure the expandable view is accessible to all users?

5. **Mobile Experience**: How should we adapt this approach for mobile users?

I've attached the full proposal document for your review. Would you be available for a 30-minute discussion next Monday at 2:00 PM to go over your feedback?

Thank you again for your valuable suggestion that led to this proposal. I'm excited about the potential to further enhance our documentation usability.

Best regards,
Taylor
