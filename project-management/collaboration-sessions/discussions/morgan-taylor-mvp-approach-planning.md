# Morgan-Taylor MVP Approach Planning Session

**Date and Time**: [Current Date], 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
**Participants**: 
- Morgan (Documentation Project Manager)
- Taylor (Senior Technical Writer)

**Topic**: Revamping the documentation project for an accelerated MVP approach

## Background

Management has informed us that the development team needs the documentation for the Azure DevOps Node API project much faster than previously anticipated. We need to revamp our approach to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) documentation set that meets the most critical needs of the development team while leveraging the standards and templates we've already established.

## Key Discussion Points

### Current Project Status
- We have a comprehensive documentation strategy and implementation plan spanning 26+ weeks
- We've established robust documentation standards, templates, and style guides
- The current plan is too extensive for the accelerated timeline needed by the development team

### MVP Documentation Requirements
- Identify the most critical documentation needs for developers
- Determine which API clients and methods are highest priority
- Establish a streamlined approach to documentation creation
- Leverage existing templates and standards to maintain quality

### Resource Allocation
- Evaluate current team assignments and potentially redistribute
- Identify opportunities for parallel work streams
- Consider bringing in additional resources if necessary

## Decisions

### MVP Documentation Scope
1. Focus on the following core components:
   - Getting Started Guide (simplified)
   - Authentication Documentation
   - WebApi Core Documentation
   - Work Item Tracking API (highest priority for dev team)
   - Git API (second highest priority)
   - Build API (third highest priority)

2. For each API client, prioritize:
   - Basic connection and authentication
   - Most commonly used methods (top 5-7 per client)
   - Essential code examples
   - Common error scenarios

3. Defer the following to post-MVP:
   - Comprehensive API reference for all methods
   - Advanced scenarios and tutorials
   - Rich visual content
   - Interactive examples
   - Video tutorials

### Timeline Adjustment
- Compress the original 26-week timeline to 8 weeks for MVP
- Implement a phased approach with bi-weekly deliverables
- Set up continuous deployment of documentation as it's completed

### Template Utilization
- Leverage existing templates but simplify implementation
- Use the established style guide for consistency
- Implement a streamlined review process

## Action Items

1. **Morgan**: 
   - Update the implementation plan with the new MVP approach
   - Revise the task breakdown to reflect the new priorities
   - Adjust team assignments based on the new focus areas
   - Schedule a team meeting to communicate the changes

2. **Taylor**:
   - Create a simplified template implementation guide for the MVP
   - Identify the most critical sections of each template to prioritize
   - Develop a streamlined review process for faster turnaround
   - Create a documentation priority matrix for API methods

## Follow-up

- Reconvene in 2 days to review the updated implementation plan and task breakdown
- Schedule a full team meeting for next week to align everyone with the new approach
- Set up weekly check-ins to monitor progress against the accelerated timeline

## Notes

This MVP approach doesn't replace our comprehensive documentation strategy but represents a necessary pivot to meet immediate developer needs. We'll continue to build on the MVP foundation to eventually achieve our complete documentation vision.
