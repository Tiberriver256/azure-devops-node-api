## Overview

Jamie reviewed the troubleshooting guide template with a focus on user experience, information architecture, and GitHub-specific constraints. The review covered both the template structure and the implementation guide.

## Key Feedback Points

### Strengths

1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Effective use of GitHub's collapsible sections
   - Clear hierarchy from quick solutions to detailed troubleshooting
   - Well-structured navigation between sections

2. **Information Architecture**
   - Logical organization of content
   - Clear separation of concerns between different template components
