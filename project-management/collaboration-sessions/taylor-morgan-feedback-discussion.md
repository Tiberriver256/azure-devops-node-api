# Meeting Notes: Taylor & Morgan - Template Review Implementation Planning

**Date:** July 21, 2024  
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM  
**Participants:** Taylor (Senior Technical Writer), Morgan (Documentation Project Manager)  
**Topic:** Planning Implementation of Template Review Feedback

## Meeting Summary

Taylor and Morgan met to discuss the refined feedback from the template review workshop and the solutions developed with Jamie. They focused on prioritizing implementation tasks, aligning with project constraints, and creating a realistic timeline for completing task 3.20 (Review templates with team).

## Discussion Points

### Review of Technical Constraints

**Morgan:** "Before we dive into the implementation plan, let's review our technical constraints to make sure we're aligned."

**Taylor:** "Our documentation is hosted exclusively as GitHub markdown files. We can't use custom HTML/CSS styling beyond what GitHub supports, no JavaScript, and no interactive elements. We're limited to GitHub-flavored markdown features like tables, code blocks, and the `<details>` tag for collapsible sections."

**Morgan:** "Exactly. And we need to be mindful of maintainability. Any solutions we implement need to be sustainable across all our templates and easy for the team to maintain going forward."

### Feedback from Jamie Meeting

**Taylor:** "I met with Jamie yesterday to discuss how we can implement the UX-related feedback within our constraints. We came up with several practical solutions that work within GitHub's limitations."

**Taylor shared the key solutions:**
- Using consistent header levels and strategic whitespace for visual hierarchy
- Implementing text-based breadcrumbs for navigation
- Using emojis as visual anchors for different content types
- Adding time estimates to tutorial sections
- Creating simple text-based progress indicators
- Using horizontal rules for visual separation in troubleshooting guides
- Creating a static flowchart image for the decision tree

**Morgan:** "These solutions make sense and align with our constraints. I particularly like the breadcrumb navigation and the emoji indicators - they're simple but effective improvements."

### Prioritization and Timeline

**Morgan:** "Given our current timeline and resources, we need to be strategic about what we implement. What do you see as the highest priority items?"

**Taylor:** "Based on my discussion with Jamie, we identified these high-priority items:
1. Consistent breadcrumb navigation
2. Method importance indicators
3. Time estimates for tutorials
4. Quick fix summary for troubleshooting guides
5. Visual separation in troubleshooting guides"

**Morgan:** "I agree with that prioritization. These items address the most critical feedback while being relatively straightforward to implement. What about Casey's feedback on error handling examples and diagnostic tools?"

**Taylor:** "Those are important too, but they require more technical input. I suggest we focus on the UX improvements first, then work with Casey on enhancing the technical content in a second phase."

**Morgan:** "That's a good approach. Let's plan to complete the high-priority UX improvements by the end of next week, then schedule time with Casey for the technical enhancements."

### Implementation Strategy

**Taylor:** "I'm thinking we should create a Visual Elements Guide first to document all these patterns, then update one template of each type as examples, and finally update the remaining templates."

**Morgan:** "That's a solid approach. Creating the guide first will ensure consistency across all templates. For the example templates, I suggest:
- API Reference Template: WorkItemTrackingApi
- Tutorial Template: Creating Work Items
- Troubleshooting Guide Template: Authentication Issues
- Template Selection Guide"

**Taylor:** "Those are good choices. They're representative of their template types and already have substantial content to work with."

**Morgan:** "Once we have those examples, we can review them with Jordan and Casey before implementing across all templates. This will give us a chance to refine the approach based on their feedback."

### Resource Allocation

**Morgan:** "Do you have the bandwidth to take this on, or should we involve Jordan more directly?"

**Taylor:** "I can handle the Visual Elements Guide and the initial template updates. Jamie has already agreed to create the static flowchart image for the decision tree. We should involve Jordan for review, but I don't think we need to pull them into the implementation at this stage."

**Morgan:** "That sounds reasonable. And what about the technical enhancements Casey suggested?"

**Taylor:** "For those, I'll need Casey's input. I suggest scheduling a focused session with Casey next week to work on the error handling examples and diagnostic tools enhancements."

**Morgan:** "Good plan. I'll arrange that session."

## Action Plan for Task 3.20

**Morgan:** "Let's outline the specific steps needed to complete task 3.20 based on our discussion."

**Taylor and Morgan agreed on the following action plan:**

1. **Documentation (July 22-23)**
   - Create Visual Elements Guide documenting all standardized patterns
   - Document implementation guidelines for each enhancement

2. **Example Implementation (July 24-26)**
   - Update WorkItemTrackingApi template with navigation and method indicators
   - Update Creating Work Items tutorial with time estimates and progress indicators
   - Update Authentication Issues troubleshooting guide with visual separation and quick fix summary
   - Update Template Selection Guide with improved organization (prepare for flowchart addition)

3. **Review and Refinement (July 27-28)**
   - Review example implementations with Jamie
   - Make refinements based on feedback

4. **Technical Enhancements (July 29-30)**
   - Work with Casey on error handling examples
   - Enhance diagnostic tools section in troubleshooting guide

5. **Final Review (July 31)**
   - Present updated templates to Jordan and Casey
   - Collect final feedback

6. **Documentation (August 1)**
   - Document implementation process for remaining templates
   - Create template update checklist

**Morgan:** "This timeline looks achievable and addresses the key feedback while respecting our constraints. Do you see any potential issues or bottlenecks?"

**Taylor:** "The main risk is the technical enhancements with Casey. Those might take longer than expected depending on the complexity. We should build in some buffer time there."

**Morgan:** "Good point. Let's allocate an extra day for that work and be prepared to adjust if needed."

## Deliverables

**Morgan:** "To summarize, what are the key deliverables for task 3.20?"

**Taylor:** "The deliverables will be:
1. Visual Elements Guide
2. Updated example templates (one of each type)
3. Implementation guidelines for remaining templates
4. Template update checklist
5. Final presentation of improvements to the team"

**Morgan:** "Perfect. And the completion criteria?"

**Taylor:** "Task 3.20 will be considered complete when:
1. The Visual Elements Guide is finalized
2. The example templates are updated and approved
3. The implementation guidelines are documented
4. The final review with Jordan and Casey is completed"

**Morgan:** "Agreed. This gives us a clear path to completion while ensuring we address the valuable feedback from the workshop."

## Next Steps

1. **Taylor to begin:**
   - Creating the Visual Elements Guide
   - Drafting implementation guidelines

2. **Morgan to:**
   - Schedule session with Casey for technical enhancements
   - Update project timeline to reflect this plan
   - Inform Jordan and Casey of the implementation approach

3. **Follow-up meeting:**
   - Review progress on July 26
   - Adjust timeline if needed

## Conclusion

**Morgan:** "I think we have a solid plan that balances addressing the feedback with our technical constraints and timeline. The phased approach makes sense, focusing on high-impact improvements first."

**Taylor:** "Agreed. This plan gives us a clear path forward while ensuring we're creating sustainable, maintainable documentation that works within our GitHub-only constraints."

**Morgan:** "Let's get started with the Visual Elements Guide and check in on Friday to see how it's progressing."
