# Proposal: Expandable View for Complex API Reference Documentation

**Date:** March 23, 2023  
**Author:** Taylor (Senior Technical Writer)  
**Subject:** Applying Multi-File Principles to Complex API Reference Documentation

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines an approach to enhance the usability of complex API reference documentation by applying the successful multi-file principles from our tutorial template. The proposed "Expandable View" would maintain the benefits of comprehensive single-file reference documentation while addressing cognitive load concerns for particularly complex classes, interfaces, and methods.

This approach would be selectively applied only to the most complex components of the Azure DevOps Node API, where the current single-file approach may overwhelm users with excessive information.

## Background

Our recent implementation of a multi-file structure for tutorials has received positive feedback from both the UI/UX team and internal reviewers. The approach successfully addresses cognitive load concerns by breaking complex content into manageable sections with clear navigation.

While reference documentation generally benefits from having all information in a single file for searchability and context, our user research indicates that particularly complex API components (those with numerous methods, properties, and examples) can overwhelm users, making it difficult to find specific information.

## Proposed Solution: Expandable View

The proposed solution would maintain the current single-file approach as the default view while adding an optional "Expandable View" for complex components. This would give users the choice of how they want to consume the documentation based on their needs.

### Key Features

1. **Default Single-File View**: Maintains the comprehensive single-file approach for all API reference documentation
2. **Optional Expansion**: Adds a toggle option for complex components to expand into a multi-file view
3. **Logical Section Breakdown**: Divides complex documentation into logical sections (Overview, Properties, Methods, Examples, etc.)
4. **Consistent Navigation**: Implements the same navigation system used in the tutorial template
5. **Persistent Context**: Ensures users maintain context when navigating between expanded sections

### Implementation Approach

#### 1. Selection Criteria

Apply the Expandable View option only to API components that meet specific complexity thresholds:

- Classes/Interfaces with more than 15 methods or properties
- Methods with more than 10 parameters or complex return types
- Components with extensive examples or usage scenarios
- Components that frequently appear in user support inquiries

#### 2. Technical Implementation

Two implementation options are proposed:

**Option A: Client-Side Toggle (Preferred)**
- Maintain a single Markdown file for each component
- Use JavaScript to dynamically split and display content as separate "pages"
- Implement toggle controls to switch between single-file and expanded views
- Store user preference in browser local storage

**Option B: Separate File Generation**
- Generate both single-file and multi-file versions during the documentation build process
- Provide links to toggle between views
- Maintain a single source file to ensure content consistency

#### 3. User Interface

The toggle would be implemented as a prominent control at the top of complex component documentation:

```
[View as: (â€¢) Single Page | ( ) Expanded Sections]
```

When "Expanded Sections" is selected, the page would transform to show:

1. A table of contents for the component sections
2. The current section's content
3. Navigation controls to move between sections

## Pilot Implementation

I propose implementing this approach as a pilot for the `WorkItemTrackingApi` class, which is one of our most complex components with numerous methods, properties, and usage examples. This would allow us to:

1. Test the technical implementation
2. Gather user feedback
3. Refine the approach before wider implementation
4. Measure impact on documentation usability

## Benefits

1. **Improved Usability**: Reduces cognitive load for complex components while maintaining comprehensive coverage
2. **User Choice**: Allows users to choose the documentation format that best suits their needs
3. **Consistent Experience**: Applies the successful navigation patterns from our tutorial template
4. **Searchability**: Maintains the benefits of single-file documentation for search and reference
5. **Targeted Approach**: Focuses enhancements on the components that would benefit most

## Considerations and Mitigations

| Consideration | Mitigation |
|---------------|------------|
| Maintenance Complexity | Maintain single-source files with appropriate markup to generate both views |
| Performance Impact | Implement lazy loading for expanded sections to minimize initial load time |
| SEO Implications | Ensure proper canonical URL implementation to avoid duplicate content issues |
| Consistency Across Documentation | Apply only to components that meet specific complexity thresholds |
| User Confusion | Provide clear instructions and tooltips explaining the toggle functionality |

## Resource Requirements

- **Development**: 3-5 days for initial implementation (Dakota from DevOps team)
- **Content Updates**: 2-3 days to update the `WorkItemTrackingApi` documentation (Taylor)
- **Testing**: 2 days for usability testing with internal users
- **Refinement**: 2-3 days based on feedback

## Timeline

| Week | Activities |
|------|------------|
| Week 1 | Finalize design and technical approach |
| Week 2 | Implement pilot for `WorkItemTrackingApi` class |
| Week 3 | Conduct internal testing and gather feedback |
| Week 4 | Refine implementation based on feedback |
| Week 5 | Present results and recommendation for wider implementation |

## Success Metrics

We will measure the success of this approach using:

1. **User Feedback**: Surveys and interviews with internal and external users
2. **Usage Data**: Analytics on how often users toggle between views
3. **Support Inquiries**: Changes in support questions related to complex API components
4. **Time on Page**: Whether users spend more or less time finding information

## Recommendation

I recommend proceeding with the pilot implementation for the `WorkItemTrackingApi` class using the client-side toggle approach (Option A). This will allow us to validate the concept with minimal changes to our documentation infrastructure while gathering valuable user feedback.

If successful, we can expand this approach to other complex components based on the selection criteria outlined above.

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal with the Documentation team and UI/UX team
2. Secure resources for the pilot implementation
3. Develop detailed technical specifications
4. Implement the pilot for `WorkItemTrackingApi`
5. Gather and analyze feedback
