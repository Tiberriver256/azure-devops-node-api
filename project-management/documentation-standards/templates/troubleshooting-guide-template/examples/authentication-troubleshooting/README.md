# Authentication Troubleshooting Guide Example

This directory contains an example implementation of the multi-file troubleshooting guide template, focused on authentication issues with the Azure DevOps Node API.

## Purpose of This Example

This example demonstrates how to:

1. Implement the multi-file structure for a troubleshooting guide
2. Organize content for optimal user navigation
3. Create effective navigation patterns between files
4. Use GitHub-compatible interactive elements
5. Structure problem solutions consistently

## Example Structure

```
authentication-troubleshooting/
├── README.md                      # This file - explains the example
├── index.md                       # Main entry point focused on auth issues
├── quick-solutions.md             # Common authentication quick fixes
└── sections/
    ├── issue-identification.md    # How to identify auth problems
    ├── problem-categories/
    │   ├── token-issues.md        # PAT and token problems
    │   ├── identity-issues.md     # AAD, MSA, and identity issues
    │   └── scope-permission-issues.md # Scope and permission problems
    ├── error-code-reference.md    # Auth-specific error codes
    ├── advanced-troubleshooting.md # Advanced auth diagnostics
    ├── decision-tree.md           # Auth-focused decision tree
    └── getting-help.md            # Auth-specific help resources
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information presented from simple to complex
- **Visual Navigation**: Category cards, decision trees, and navigation aids
- **Consistent Problem Structure**: Using the recommended structure for each issue
- **Interactive Elements**: Collapsible sections, code examples, and checklists
- **Cross-References**: Related issues and next/previous navigation

## How to Use This Example

This example can be used as a reference when creating your own troubleshooting guide:

1. Study the structure and organization
2. Note how navigation is implemented between files
3. See how issue details are structured within problem files
4. Observe the use of GitHub-compatible formatting
5. Use as a starting point for your own authentication troubleshooting guide
