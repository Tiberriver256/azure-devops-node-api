# Troubleshooting Guide Template Changelog and Feedback

## Recent Changes (Date: Current Date)

### 1. Replaced HTML Tables with Markdown Tables

**Files Modified:**
- `index.md` (main template)
- `examples/authentication-troubleshooting/index.md`

**Reason for Change:**
HTML tables may not render properly in all environments. Standard markdown tables are more universally compatible and align with our documentation standards.

**Before:**
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
      <p>üîí</p>
      <h3><a href="...">Authentication Issues</a></h3>
      <p>Problems with tokens, credentials, and identity</p>
    </td>
    <!-- Additional cells... -->
  </tr>
</table>
```

**After:**
```markdown
| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| üîí [Authentication Issues](./sections/problem-categories/authentication-issues.md) | Problems with tokens, credentials, and identity |
| üåê [Connection Problems](./sections/problem-categories/connection-problems.md) | Network, proxy, and connectivity issues |
<!-- Additional rows... -->
```

### 2. Improved Decision Tree Format

**Files Modified:**
- `sections/decision-tree.md`
- `index.md` (decision tree preview)
- `examples/authentication-troubleshooting/index.md` (decision tree preview)

**Reason for Change:**
The previous ASCII art decision trees in code blocks couldn't properly render clickable links. The new nested bulleted list format provides a clearer structure with functional links.

**Before:**
````markdown
```
Are you having trouble connecting to Azure DevOps?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes, I can't authenticate at all ‚Üí 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Do you get a 401 Unauthorized error? ‚Üí
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí [Invalid Token](./problem-categories/authentication-issues.md#invalid-token)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Continue
<!-- Additional branches... -->
```
````

**After:**
```markdown
**Are you having trouble connecting to Azure DevOps?**

* **Yes, I can't authenticate at all**
  * Do you get a 401 Unauthorized error?
    * Yes ‚Üí [Invalid Token](./problem-categories/authentication-issues.md#invalid-token)
    * No ‚Üí Continue below
  <!-- Additional options... -->
```

### 3. Updated Documentation Standards

**Files Modified:**
- `docs-tech-stack.md`
- `README.md`

**Changes:**
- Added clear guidance that HTML should generally be avoided except for `<details>` and `<summary>` tags
- Updated the GitHub-Compatible Interactive Elements section to reflect these changes
- Added a warning about HTML tables in the README

## Potential Feedback from Jessie

As a Documentation UX Specialist, Jessie might provide the following feedback:

### Positive Feedback
1. **Improved Accessibility**: The changes make the documentation more accessible across different environments and screen readers.
2. **Consistent Standards**: The updates bring the template in line with our documentation standards, creating more consistency.
3. **Functional Links**: The new decision tree format ensures all links are clickable, improving navigation.
4. **Better Navigation Structure**: The markdown tables maintain a clean, organized structure while ensuring compatibility.

### Areas for Further Improvement
1. **Visual Distinctiveness**: Standard markdown tables may not be as visually distinctive as the HTML tables were. We might consider:
   - Using emoji more prominently in the table headers
   - Adding horizontal rules between major sections
   - Using bold text more strategically to create visual hierarchy

2. **Decision Tree Enhancements**: While the nested bulleted lists are functional, we could:
   - Add more visual cues like emoji at different decision points
   - Consider using blockquotes to highlight key decision points
   - Add miniature "maps" at the top of each section showing where users are in the decision process

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Consider testing how the tables render on mobile devices and ensure they're readable on smaller screens.

4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Consider if we can use collapsible sections (`<details>`) more effectively in the decision tree to hide complex branches until needed.

## Next Steps

1. Share these changes with Jessie for review and additional feedback
2. Test the new format in various environments to ensure compatibility
3. Update any remaining documentation that might still use HTML tables
4. Consider creating a documentation linting tool that checks for HTML usage other than allowed tags
