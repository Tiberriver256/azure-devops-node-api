# [DEPRECATED] Troubleshooting Guide Template - Usage Guide (Single-File Version)

> **Important:** This guide for the single-file template is deprecated. Please use the new multi-file structure documented in the [README.md](./README.md) file. The multi-file approach provides better navigation, maintainability, and user experience.

This document provides detailed guidance on how to use the Troubleshooting Guide Template to create effective troubleshooting documentation for the Azure DevOps Node API.

## Overview

The Troubleshooting Guide Template is designed to help users quickly identify and resolve common issues when working with the Azure DevOps Node API. It follows a problem-solution structure with an emphasis on quick diagnostics and clear resolutions.

## When to Use This Template

Use this template when:

- You're documenting common issues and their solutions for specific API components
- You're creating a guide for a specific error scenario (authentication issues, connection problems, etc.)
- You need to provide diagnostic tools and techniques for complex troubleshooting
- You're documenting error codes and their resolutions

## Template Structure

The template is organized to address both quick solutions for common problems and in-depth troubleshooting for more complex issues:

1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of what the guide covers
2. **Quick Solutions**: Table of common issues and their quick fixes
3. **Issue Identification**: Symptoms and diagnostic approaches
4. **Common Problems and Solutions**: Detailed breakdowns of issues by category
5. **Error Code Reference**: Table of error codes and their meanings
6. **Advanced Troubleshooting**: More detailed techniques for complex cases
7. **Decision Tree**: Visual guidance for navigating to the right solution
8. **Version-Specific Issues**: Problems related to specific API versions
9. **Getting Help**: What to do if the guide doesn't solve the problem
10. **Related Resources**: Links to related documentation

## Filling in the Template

### Metadata and Introduction

1. Replace `[Troubleshooting Guide Name]` with a descriptive title.
2. Fill in the metadata section:
   - **Complexity**: Indicate how complex the issues are (Basic ⭐, Intermediate ⭐⭐, Advanced ⭐⭐⭐)
   - **Related API Components**: List the API components this guide relates to
   - **Related Error Codes**: List the primary error codes covered
   - **API Version Applicability**: Note which API versions this guide applies to

3. Write a 1-2 sentence introduction that describes what issues this guide addresses.
4. Create a concise TL;DR summary for readers who need immediate help.

### Quick Solutions for Common Issues

This section should provide immediate answers for the most common problems:

1. Identify 3-5 of the most frequent issues users encounter.
2. Provide brief, actionable solutions that can be implemented quickly.
3. Order them from most common to least common.

Example:
```markdown
| Issue | Quick Solution |
|-------|----------------|
| API connection timeout | Ensure your network allows HTTPS connections to dev.azure.com |
| Authentication failure | Verify your Personal Access Token is valid and has not expired |
| 404 Not Found errors | Confirm the organization and project names are correct in your URL |
```

### Diagnostic Checklist

The collapsible diagnostic checklist should include common verification steps:

1. List 5-8 key verification steps that address the most common root causes.
2. Make them actionable and specific.
3. Order them in a logical sequence (from basic to more complex checks).

### Issue Identification

This section helps users determine if this guide addresses their specific problem:

1. **Symptoms**: Describe the observable signs of the problems covered in this guide.
2. **Error Messages**: Include exact error messages users might encounter.
3. **Unexpected Behaviors**: Describe behaviors that indicate problems but might not generate errors.

For the diagnostic tools section:

1. Provide relevant diagnostic code snippets that users can run to identify issues.
2. Include logging techniques that can help gather more information.
3. Add environment verification steps to ensure proper setup.

### Common Problems and Solutions

This section forms the core of the troubleshooting guide:

1. Organize issues into logical categories (e.g., "Authentication Issues", "Connection Problems").
2. For each issue, provide:
   - Clear issue description
   - Potential root causes
   - Step-by-step solution with code examples when applicable
   - Prevention tips to avoid the issue in the future

3. Use collapsible sections (`<details>` tags) to keep the guide scannable.

Example category organization:
- Authentication Issues
- Connection Problems
- Data Retrieval Issues
- Permission Problems
- Rate Limiting and Performance Issues

### Error Code Reference

Create a comprehensive table of error codes relevant to the guide:

1. Include the exact error code (e.g., `VS403404` or HTTP status codes like `401`)
2. Provide the typical error message
3. Give a brief description of what causes the error
4. Provide a concise solution or link to a specific section in the guide

### Advanced Troubleshooting

This section is for complex or unusual issues:

1. Include more sophisticated diagnostic techniques
2. Provide recovery procedures for serious problems
3. Add example code for advanced error handling or diagnostic procedures
4. Remember to keep these sections in collapsible `<details>` tags

### Troubleshooting Decision Tree

Create a decision tree that helps users navigate to the right solution:

1. Start with the most general symptoms
2. Branch into more specific conditions
3. End with links or references to specific solutions
4. Keep the tree reasonably sized (3-4 levels max)

The ASCII tree format in the template can be customized for your specific issues.

### Version-Specific Issues

Document differences between API versions:

1. Create a separate collapsible section for each relevant API version
2. Document known issues specific to that version
3. Provide workarounds for version-specific limitations
4. Note any deprecation or breaking changes

### Getting Help and Related Resources

Complete the guide with guidance on getting additional help:

1. Provide accurate links to GitHub issues, support channels, etc.
2. List related documentation that might be helpful
3. Include links to relevant API references

## Best Practices for Troubleshooting Guides

### Content Best Practices

1. **Be specific and concrete**: Avoid vague instructions like "check your settings" - specify exactly which settings to check.
2. **Use real examples**: Include authentic error messages and logs (with sensitive information removed).
3. **Include code samples**: Provide working code that users can adapt to their situations.
4. **Show both symptoms and solutions**: Clearly connect symptoms to their solutions.
5. **Use a logical organization**: Order issues from most common to least common.
6. **Include prevention tips**: Help users avoid running into the same problems again.

### Formatting Best Practices

1. **Use collapsible sections**: Keep the document scannable by using `<details>` tags for detailed information.
2. **Format error messages distinctly**: Use code blocks for error messages to make them stand out.
3. **Use tables for quick reference**: Tables are great for error codes and quick solutions.
4. **Include a decision tree**: Visual guidance helps users navigate complex troubleshooting.
5. **Use consistent typography**: Follow the style guide for heading levels, bold/italic usage, etc.
6. **Add "TL;DR" summaries**: Quick summaries help readers determine if a section is relevant.

## Example Implementation

For a complete example of a troubleshooting guide using this template, see the [Authentication Troubleshooting Guide](../examples/authentication-troubleshooting.md) in the examples directory.

## Template Customization

While following the template structure is recommended for consistency, you can customize it for specific needs:

- **For simple issues**: You may not need the advanced troubleshooting sections
- **For API-specific guides**: Focus more on the API-specific error codes and behaviors
- **For architectural issues**: You might expand the diagnostic tools section

When in doubt, include more information in collapsible sections rather than omitting it.
