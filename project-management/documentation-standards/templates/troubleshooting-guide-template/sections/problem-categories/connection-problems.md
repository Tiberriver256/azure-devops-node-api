> **Navigation**: [Home](../index.md) > Connection Problems

This section provides troubleshooting guidance for common connection and network issues encountered when using the Azure DevOps Node API.

## Common Connection Problems

### Timeouts
- **Description:** Requests to the Azure DevOps API taking longer than expected and eventually timing out.
- **Possible Causes:**
  - High network latency
  - Service overload
  - Firewall or proxy interference
- **Recommended Steps:**
  - Verify your internet connection.
  - Try increasing the timeout settings in your API client.
  - Use diagnostic tools (see the [Issue Identification](../issue-identification.md) page for a connection diagnostics code snippet).

### Intermittent Connection Failures
- **Description:** Occasional connection failures that occur randomly.
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Unstable network conditions
  - Misconfigured proxy or firewall settings
- **Recommended Steps:**
  - Check network stability and run ping tests.
  - Review and adjust your proxy/firewall configurations.
  - Retry the connection to see if the issue persists.

### Service Unavailability
- **Description:** API calls returning errors that indicate the service is temporarily unavailable.
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Azure DevOps server maintenance or heavy load
  - API rate limiting or throttling
- **Recommended Steps:**
  - Check the Azure DevOps status page for outages.
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff in your API calls.
  - Monitor your API rate limits and adjust usage if necessary.

### Network Instability
- **Description:** Slow or disrupted connections that might affect API calls.
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Regional network issues
  - VPN or proxy complications
- **Recommended Steps:**
  - Validate your network settings and perform connectivity tests (e.g., ping, traceroute).
  - Disable or reconfigure VPN/proxy settings if needed.
  - Consult your network administrator if issues persist.

## Diagnostic Tools

For further diagnosis, consider using these tools:
- Connection Diagnostics code sample (refer to the [Issue Identification](../issue-identification.md) page).
- Terminal commands like ping and traceroute to test network connectivity.
- Detailed logging as outlined in the [Advanced Troubleshooting](../advanced-troubleshooting.md) guide.
