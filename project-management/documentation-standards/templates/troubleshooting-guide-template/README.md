## Visual Style Guide

### Issue Severity Indicators

Use these emoji indicators consistently throughout the documentation:

- üî¥ High Severity - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- üü° Medium Severity - Important issues that should be addressed soon
- üü¢ Low Severity - Minor issues or optimization opportunities

### Time Indicators

Include estimated time to fix using the following format:
> **Quick Fix** | ‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes | üî¥ High Severity

### Issue Type Icons

- üîë Authentication Issues
- üåê Network/Connection Issues
- üíæ Data/Storage Issues
- üîí Permission Issues
- ‚ö° Performance Issues
- üîç Search/Query Issues
- üîÑ Sync/Update Issues

### Section Separators

Use horizontal rules (---) to create clear visual separation between major sections.

## Template Components

### 1. Main Entry Point (index.md)

The `index.md` file serves as the main entry point and should include:

- Brief description of the component/feature
- Table of common issue categories with links
- Quick navigation to key sections
- Decision tree reference for guided troubleshooting

### 2. Quick Solutions (quick-solutions.md)

The `quick-solutions.md` file should contain:

- Table of common issues with symptoms and solutions
- Time and severity indicators for each solution
- Code snippets for immediate fixes
- Links to detailed documentation for each issue
- Diagnostic code examples

Example quick solution format:

> **Authentication Failed** | ‚è±Ô∏è 2 minutes | üî¥ High Severity
>
> Common authentication failures can be resolved by regenerating your Personal Access Token (PAT).
> ```typescript
> // Example fix
> const newPat = await generateNewPat();
> ```

### 3. Issue Identification (sections/issue-identification.md)

This section helps users identify their specific issue:

- Common symptoms and error messages
- Diagnostic tools and code
- Issue categorization guidance
- Links to relevant problem categories

### 4. Error Code Reference (sections/error-code-reference.md)

A comprehensive listing of error codes:

- HTTP status codes
- API-specific error codes
- Error message patterns
- Solutions for each error code

### 5. Problem Categories

Each problem category should have its own file in `sections/problem-categories/` with:

<details>
<summary><b>Category File Template</b></summary>

```markdown
# [Category Name]

> **Navigation**: [Home](../../index.md) > [Category Name]

Brief description of this category of issues.

## In This Category

- [Issue 1](#issue-1)
- [Issue 2](#issue-2)
