Learn how to programmatically create, update, and manage work items in Azure DevOps using the Node API. This tutorial will help you build automation solutions that integrate with your existing workflows and external systems.

## Overview

Work items are the core tracking elements in Azure DevOps, representing everything from user stories and tasks to bugs and test cases. While the Azure DevOps web interface provides robust tools for managing work items manually, many scenarios benefit from automation:

- **Integration with external systems**: Automatically create work items from customer support tickets, feedback forms, or other external sources
- **Bulk operations**: Create or update multiple related work items in a single operation
- **Custom workflows**: Implement business-specific processes that extend beyond standard Azure DevOps capabilities
- **Consistency enforcement**: Ensure work items follow specific templates and contain required information

This tutorial uses the Azure DevOps Node API's `WorkItemTrackingApi` to interact with work items. You'll learn how to:

1. Connect to Azure DevOps and authenticate
2. Create basic work items with required fields
3. Add advanced fields, attachments, and links
4. Implement error handling and retry logic
5. Build practical automation scenarios

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a robust foundation for building work item automation solutions tailored to your specific needs.
