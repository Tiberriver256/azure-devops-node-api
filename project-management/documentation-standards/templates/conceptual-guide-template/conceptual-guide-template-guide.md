# Conceptual Guide Template Guide

This document provides guidance on how to use the Conceptual Guide Template effectively. Conceptual guides explain abstract concepts, architectures, and design principles without focusing on specific code implementations.

## Purpose

The Conceptual Guide Template serves several important purposes:

1. **Explain abstract concepts** related to Azure DevOps and its APIs
2. **Provide context and background** for developers working with the API
3. **Help users understand "why"** rather than just "how"
4. **Establish foundations** for more specific documentation
5. **Bridge knowledge gaps** between different API features

## When to Use

Use the Conceptual Guide Template when:

- Explaining the architecture or design of Azure DevOps systems
- Documenting important concepts that span multiple API components
- Introducing terminology and mental models needed to understand the API
- Providing background information necessary for effective API usage
- Explaining relationships between different system components

For step-by-step instructions, use the [Tutorial Template](../tutorial-template/) instead. For documenting specific API methods or classes, use the appropriate API template.

## Template Structure

The Conceptual Guide Template includes the following sections:

1. **Title**: Clear, concise name of the concept
2. **Introduction**: Brief introduction to the concept
3. **Overview**: Comprehensive explanation of the concept and its importance
4. **Key Components**: Breakdown of major elements or components
5. **How It Works**: Detailed explanation of the concept's functioning
6. **Practical Applications**: Real-world usage scenarios
7. **Relationship to Other Components**: How this concept connects to other parts of the system
8. **Best Practices**: Guidance on effective usage
9. **Common Pitfalls**: Issues to avoid when working with this concept
10. **Code Representations**: (Optional) Code examples that illustrate the concept
11. **Advanced Topics**: (Collapsible) In-depth technical details
12. **Related Resources**: Links to related documentation

## How to Fill Out the Template

### Title and Introduction

Start with a clear, descriptive title and a brief introduction:

```markdown
# Authentication Concepts

Azure DevOps authentication mechanisms provide secure access to resources while supporting multiple identity providers and access methods.
```

### Overview

Provide a comprehensive explanation of the concept:

```markdown
## Overview

Authentication in Azure DevOps is the process of verifying the identity of users and services before granting access to resources. The Azure DevOps Node API supports multiple authentication methods, allowing developers to choose the approach that best fits their security requirements and operational constraints.

Understanding authentication is critical for developing secure applications that interact with Azure DevOps APIs, as different authentication methods provide different security guarantees and are suitable for different usage scenarios.
```

### Key Components

Break down the concept into key elements:

```markdown
## Key Components

- **Identity Providers**: Authentication systems that verify user identities (Microsoft Account, Azure AD, etc.)
- **Tokens**: Secure credentials used to authenticate API requests
- **Scopes**: Permission sets that define what actions can be performed
- **Sessions**: Context in which authentication is valid
```

### How It Works

Explain the mechanisms and processes in detail:

```markdown
## How It Works

Authentication with the Azure DevOps API typically follows these steps:

1. The client obtains credentials from an identity provider
2. The client includes these credentials with API requests
3. The Azure DevOps service validates the credentials
4. If valid, the service processes the request and returns a response

[Include a diagram illustrating the authentication flow]

### Token-based Authentication

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) provide a simple authentication mechanism...

### OAuth Authentication

For web applications that need to act on behalf of users...
```

### Practical Applications

Describe real-world usage scenarios:

```markdown
## Practical Applications

### Common Use Cases

- **Automated Build Scripts**: Use service principal authentication for CI/CD pipelines
- **Web Applications**: Use OAuth to allow users to authorize actions in their projects
- **Command-Line Tools**: Use Personal Access Tokens for simple scripting scenarios
```

### Relationship to Other Components

Explain how this concept relates to other parts of the system:

```markdown
## Relationship to Other Components

| Related Component | Relationship |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Authorization | Authentication establishes identity; authorization determines access rights |
| WebApi Client | The client must be configured with appropriate authentication credentials |
| Resource Areas | Different resource areas may have different authentication requirements |
```

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

Provide guidance and warnings:

```markdown
## Best Practices

- **Use the appropriate authentication method** for your scenario
- **Store credentials securely** using environment variables or secure storage
- **Implement token refresh logic** for OAuth tokens
- **Request minimal scopes** needed for your application

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Expired tokens | Tokens have a limited lifetime | Implement refresh logic or token renewal |
| Insufficient permissions | Requesting incorrect scopes | Request appropriate scopes for your needs |
| Credentials in source code | Hardcoding secrets | Use environment variables or secret management |
```

### Code Representations

Include code examples when helpful:

```markdown
## Code Representations

```typescript
// Authenticate using Personal Access Token
const authHandler = azdev.getPersonalAccessTokenHandler("your-pat-token");
const connection = new azdev.WebApi("https://dev.azure.com/organization", authHandler);

// Authenticate using OAuth token
const authHandler = azdev.getBearerHandler("your-oauth-token");
const connection = new azdev.WebApi("https://dev.azure.com/organization", authHandler);
```
```

### Advanced Topics

Use collapsible sections for advanced information:

### Related Resources

Include links to related documentation:

```markdown
## Related Resources

- [Authentication Overview](../authentication/overview.md)
- [OAuth Implementation Guide](../authentication/oauth-guide.md)
- [Microsoft Identity Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)
```

## Visual Elements

### Diagrams

Include conceptual diagrams to illustrate:
- System architecture
- Process flows
- Component relationships
- Decision trees

Use tools like Mermaid or PlantUML syntax if your documentation platform supports it.

### Tables

Use tables to organize:
- Comparisons between related concepts
- Feature matrices
- Relationship definitions

### Collapsible Sections

Use the HTML `<details>` tag for information that might overwhelm beginners:

```markdown
<details>
<summary>Click to expand advanced information</summary>

Content that might be too detailed for beginners but valuable for advanced users.

</details>
```

## Style Guidelines

### Language

- Use clear, straightforward language
- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Maintain a professional, instructional tone
- Use present tense and active voice
- Focus on explaining "why" in addition to "what"

### Organization

- Present information from general to specific
- Group related concepts together
- Use headings to create a clear information hierarchy
- Begin with foundational information before advanced topics
- Use the "progressive disclosure" principle

## Example

See the [Authentication Concepts](./examples/authentication-concepts.md) example for a complete implementation of this template.
