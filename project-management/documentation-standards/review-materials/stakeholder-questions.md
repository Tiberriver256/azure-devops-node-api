# Questions for Microsoft Documentation Stakeholders

The following questions are designed to guide our discussion with Microsoft documentation stakeholders during the style guide review. These questions focus on alignment, best practices, and potential enhancements to our documentation approach.

## Alignment with Microsoft Standards

1. How well does our style guide align with Microsoft's broader documentation standards?
2. Are there specific aspects of the Microsoft Writing Style Guide that we should emphasize more in our approach?
3. What recent changes or evolutions in Microsoft's documentation strategy should we incorporate?
4. How does our approach to voice and tone compare with other Microsoft developer documentation?

## REST API Documentation Integration

1. What are the most successful patterns from the Azure DevOps REST API documentation that we should maintain consistency with?
2. How should we approach cross-referencing between the Node.js API documentation and REST API documentation?
3. What common user journeys exist between REST and Node.js API documentation that we should support?
4. Are there plans for changes to the REST API documentation structure that we should anticipate?

## Technical Content Standards

1. What is Microsoft's recommended approach for documenting asynchronous patterns like Promises in JavaScript/TypeScript?
2. How should we balance TypeScript-specific documentation with general JavaScript accessibility?
3. What best practices should we follow for documenting breaking changes and versioning?
4. Are there specific standards for code examples that have proven most effective for developer audiences?

## User Experience Considerations

1. What user research insights from existing Microsoft developer documentation can inform our approach?
2. How should we structure our documentation to support both beginners and advanced Azure DevOps users?
3. What navigation patterns have been most successful in Microsoft's developer documentation?
4. How can we best leverage Microsoft's documentation platform features in our implementation?

## Documentation Maintenance

1. What processes has Microsoft found effective for keeping documentation in sync with API changes?
2. How should we approach documentation for preview features or beta functionality?
3. What feedback collection mechanisms have provided the most actionable insights?
4. What metrics should we track to evaluate documentation effectiveness?

## Integration with Microsoft Learn

1. How should our documentation integrate with the broader Microsoft Learn ecosystem?
2. Are there opportunities to develop learning paths or modules specific to the Azure DevOps Node API?
3. What content types beyond traditional documentation (videos, interactive tutorials, etc.) should we consider?
4. How can we leverage Microsoft certification programs or learning initiatives in our documentation strategy?

## Accessibility and Internationalization

1. What additional accessibility considerations should we incorporate beyond our current standards?
2. How should we prepare our documentation for potential localization in the future?
3. Are there specific tools or processes Microsoft recommends for accessibility validation?
4. What common accessibility pitfalls should we be particularly careful to avoid?

## Developer Community Engagement

1. How can we effectively leverage GitHub for community contributions to documentation?
2. What successful models for developer documentation contribution has Microsoft implemented?
3. How should we approach attribution and recognition for community contributions?
4. What boundaries or guidelines should we establish for community-contributed content?

## Implementation Timeline and Support

1. What resources or support can Microsoft provide during our documentation implementation?
2. Are there upcoming platform changes or features we should be aware of for our implementation plan?
3. How can we best coordinate our documentation efforts with related Microsoft initiatives?
4. What review processes should we establish with Microsoft teams for ongoing quality assurance?
