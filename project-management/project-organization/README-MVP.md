# Azure DevOps Node API Documentation: MVP Approach

## Overview

This directory contains the project organization documents for the Azure DevOps Node API documentation project, with a focus on our accelerated MVP approach. Due to urgent requirements from the development team, we've pivoted from our comprehensive 26-week plan to an 8-week MVP delivery schedule.

## MVP Documentation Strategy

Our MVP approach focuses on delivering the most critical documentation components quickly while maintaining quality through our established standards and templates. The key principles of our MVP approach are:

1. **Focused Scope**: Prioritizing the most commonly used API clients and methods
2. **Simplified Templates**: Using abbreviated versions of our comprehensive templates
3. **Accelerated Timeline**: Compressing the timeline from 26 weeks to 8 weeks
4. **Parallel Workstreams**: Implementing parallel documentation efforts
5. **Continuous Deployment**: Releasing documentation as it's completed

## Key Documents

- **[MVP Implementation Plan](mvp-implementation-plan.md)**: Outlines the accelerated 8-week plan for delivering the MVP documentation
- **[MVP Task Breakdown](mvp-task-breakdown.md)**: Details the specific tasks, assignments, and timeline for the MVP approach
- **[MVP Template Guide](mvp-template-guide.md)**: Provides guidance on simplified template implementation for the MVP
- **[Original Implementation Plan](implementation-plan.md)**: The original comprehensive implementation plan (for reference)
- **[Original Task Breakdown](task-breakdown.md)**: The original detailed task breakdown (for reference)
- **[Documentation Strategy](documentation-strategy.md)**: The overall documentation strategy (still valid, but with accelerated implementation)
- **[The Dream Team](the-dream-team.md)**: Team structure and responsibilities (being adjusted for MVP focus)

## MVP Documentation Scope

For the MVP phase, we're focusing on:

1. **Core API Clients**:
   - Work Item Tracking API (highest priority)
   - Git API (second priority)
   - Build API (third priority)
   - WebApi Core (foundation)

2. **Essential Documentation**:
   - Getting Started Guide (simplified)
   - Authentication Documentation
   - Top 5-7 methods per prioritized API client
   - Basic integration examples
   - Common error scenarios

3. **Deferred for Post-MVP**:
   - Comprehensive API reference for all methods
   - Advanced scenarios and tutorials
   - Rich visual content
   - Interactive examples
   - Video tutorials

## Timeline

The MVP documentation will be delivered in 8 weeks:

- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation setup and core framework documentation
- **Weeks 3-4**: Work Item Tracking and Git API documentation
- **Weeks 5-6**: Build API and integration examples
- **Weeks 7-8**: Refinement, final review, and release

## Team Focus

Our existing team has been realigned to focus on MVP delivery:

- **Morgan**: Overall MVP coordination and stakeholder management
- **Taylor**: Template simplification and core documentation architecture
- **Jordan & Casey**: API documentation creation and examples
- **Alex, Riley & Quinn**: Technical accuracy verification and code examples
- **Jamie**: Essential visual aids and layout optimization
- **Dakota**: Documentation infrastructure and deployment

## Success Criteria

The MVP documentation will be considered successful when:

1. Documentation for the prioritized API clients is complete
2. Essential methods for each API client are documented with examples
3. Basic integration patterns across API clients are documented
4. Development team confirms documentation meets their immediate needs
5. Documentation is deployed and accessible to all stakeholders

## Post-MVP Roadmap

After delivering the MVP documentation, we'll:

1. Gather comprehensive feedback from users
2. Develop a phased approach for remaining API clients
3. Expand documentation with advanced content
4. Enhance user experience with rich media and interactive elements

## Collaboration

All team members should refer to the [collaboration sessions](../collaboration-sessions/) directory for meeting notes and discussions related to the MVP approach. The initial planning session between Morgan and Taylor can be found at [morgan-taylor-mvp-approach-planning.md](../collaboration-sessions/discussions/morgan-taylor-mvp-approach-planning.md).
