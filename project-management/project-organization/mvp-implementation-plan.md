   - Core documentation architecture
   - Technical writing standards enforcement
   - Quality assurance

3. **Jordan & Casey (Technical Writers)**
   - API documentation creation
   - Code example documentation
   - Error handling documentation
   - Integration examples

4. **Alex, Riley & Quinn (API Specialists)**
   - Technical accuracy verification
   - Method prioritization guidance
   - Code example development
   - Technical review

5. **Jamie (UX/Design Specialist)**
   - Essential visual aids
   - Documentation layout optimization
   - Accessibility compliance

### Resource Optimization

1. **Parallel Workstreams**
   - Implement parallel documentation of different API clients
   - Establish clear handoffs between team members
   - Create shared documentation components for reuse

2. **Template Simplification**
   - Identify essential sections of existing templates
   - Create abbreviated templates for MVP documentation
   - Establish consistent structure across all documents

3. **Review Optimization**
   - Implement targeted reviews focusing on technical accuracy
   - Establish clear acceptance criteria for MVP documentation
   - Create streamlined feedback implementation process

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Scope Creep**
   - **Risk**: Expanding beyond MVP essentials delays delivery
   - **Mitigation**: Strict prioritization, clear MVP definition, regular scope reviews

2. **Quality Concerns**
   - **Risk**: Accelerated timeline impacts documentation quality
   - **Mitigation**: Leverage existing standards, focus on technical accuracy, targeted reviews

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - **Risk**: Team overwhelmed by compressed timeline
   - **Mitigation**: Clear prioritization, parallel workstreams, potential temporary resources

4. **Technical Gaps**
   - **Risk**: Missing critical information in prioritized APIs
   - **Mitigation**: Regular developer feedback, continuous deployment, iterative improvement

5. **Stakeholder Alignment**
   - **Risk**: Misalignment on MVP expectations
   - **Mitigation**: Clear communication of MVP scope, regular stakeholder updates, expectation management

## Post-MVP Roadmap

After delivering the MVP documentation, we'll:

1. **Gather Comprehensive Feedback**
   - Collect detailed usage data and feedback
   - Identify gaps and improvement areas
   - Prioritize next documentation phases

2. **Develop Phased Approach**
   - Create timeline for remaining API clients
   - Plan advanced content development
   - Schedule regular documentation updates

3. **Expand Documentation Scope**
