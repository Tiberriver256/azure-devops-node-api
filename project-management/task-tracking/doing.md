- [ ] **Editorial Reviews** (@Casey, @Jordan, Due: Apr 26)
  - Description:
    - Review all documentation for clarity and consistency
    - Ensure style guide compliance
  - Dependencies: Technical reviews
  - Status: In progress - Reviewing documentation for clarity, consistency, and style guide compliance. 
  
  **Initial Findings (Apr 26):**
  
  1. **Voice and Tone:**
     - Most documentation follows the professional but approachable tone guidelines
     - Good use of active voice and direct address in most sections
     - Some inconsistencies in technical terminology usage across different API documentation
  
  2. **Formatting and Structure:**
     - Navigation breadcrumbs are consistently implemented across documentation
     - Code examples follow consistent formatting
     - Some sections could benefit from more visual breaks (lists, headings) for improved scanability
  
  3. **Cross-References:**
     - The recent cross-reference implementation has significantly improved navigation
     - "See Also" sections are consistently implemented
     - API Cross-Reference Table provides valuable relationship information
  
  4. **Consistency Issues:**
     - Minor inconsistencies in heading capitalization styles across documents
     - Some variation in how code examples are introduced
     - Inconsistent use of bold/italic formatting for emphasis
  
  5. **Next Steps:**
     - Complete detailed review of all API reference documentation
     - Review tutorials and getting started guides
     - Create a comprehensive list of recommended edits
     - Implement high-priority clarity and consistency improvements
     - **IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Remove all ASCII diagrams from documentation as they are difficult to maintain and replace with text descriptions
