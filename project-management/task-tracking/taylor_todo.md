## MORGAN'S REVIEW COMMENTS

Taylor, this is an impressive and thorough breakdown of your tasks. I appreciate the meticulous planning and granular approach. Here are my suggestions to enhance your plan:

1. **Dependencies and Sequencing**: Consider adding explicit predecessor/successor relationships between tasks, especially for work that spans across weeks. This will help manage any scheduling conflicts.

2. **Collaboration Points**: You've included review points, which is excellent. Consider adding specific collaboration sessions with other team members like Jordan, Casey, and the API specialists beyond just reviews.

3. **Output Deliverables**: For each major section, clearly specify the tangible deliverables that others can expect.

4. **Time Estimates**: Add estimated hours for each task to help with capacity planning and to set realistic expectations.

5. **Progress Tracking**: Consider a more structured approach to status reporting - perhaps bi-weekly rather than weekly.

6. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Add checkpoints with external stakeholders (Microsoft Azure DevOps team) when applicable.

I've incorporated these suggestions in the revised plan below.

#### Template Creation
- [x] 3.13 Identify all required template types (2h)
  * **Dependency**: Requires 3.12 completion
  * **Notes**: Completed comprehensive analysis of documentation needs and identified 15 template types across four categories: API Reference Templates, Conceptual Documentation Templates, Tutorial and How-To Templates, and Supporting Documentation Templates. Created detailed documentation-template-requirements.md document with purpose, key components, and usage guidelines for each template type. Established implementation priority based on dependencies and immediate needs.
- [x] 3.14 Create API method documentation template (4h)
  * **Dependency**: Requires 3.13 completion
  * **Notes**: Completed development of the API method documentation template along with comprehensive implementation guide. Created example implementation (getWorkItems.md) to demonstrate proper template usage. Organized the documentation-standards folder structure for better organization, creating separate folders for style-guide, templates, review-materials, and implementation, with a README.md explaining the structure.
- [x] 3.15 Create class documentation template (3h)
  * **Dependency**: Requires 3.14 completion
  * **Notes**: Completed development of the class documentation template with comprehensive implementation guide. Created detailed template structure with sections for class overview, description, constructor, properties, methods, usage examples, common scenarios, error handling, and related resources. Developed a thorough example implementation (WorkItemTrackingApi.md) to demonstrate proper template usage with realistic Azure DevOps API examples.
- [x] 3.16 Create interface documentation template (3h)
  * **Dependency**: Requires 3.15 completion
  * **Collaboration**: Consulted with Alex on TypeScript interface documentation best practices (30min)

Added special sections for TypeScript-specific features like type guards and interface extensions. Incorporated cross-template navigation guidance and versioning information in the template guide.
- [x] 3.17 Create tutorial template (3h)
  * **Dependency**: Requires 3.16 completion
  * **Collaboration**: Met with Jamie (UI/UX Lead) to discuss user-centric documentation best practices (45min)
  * **Notes**: Following Morgan's suggestion, had a productive collaboration session with Jamie to gather UI/UX insights for the tutorial template. Documented key discussion points including organization around user goals rather than API features, progressive disclosure pattern, visual element best practices, accessibility considerations, learning paths and navigation, code sample best practices, and troubleshooting section format. Created a detailed set of action items to incorporate these insights into the tutorial template design. 
  
  Based on Jamie's feedback about template complexity, restructured the tutorial template into a multi-file format with a main index page and separate section files. This approach reduces cognitive load, improves navigation, and follows the progressive disclosure pattern recommended by Jamie. Created a comprehensive directory structure with clear navigation between sections, making it easier for both writers to maintain and users to consume the documentation. Updated the tutorial template guide to include instructions for using the new multi-file structure.
  
  Created a complete example implementation (work-item-automation-tutorial) that demonstrates the multi-file structure with a practical, real-world scenario. The example includes all sections: overview, prerequisites, basic implementation, advanced features, common scenarios, complete example, troubleshooting, and next steps & resources.
  
  Received very positive feedback from Jamie on the implementation. Jamie suggested additional enhancements including: visual progress indicators, per-section time estimates, collapsible code sections, interactive elements, and improved mobile responsiveness. Will implement these improvements in the next iteration. Jamie also suggested exploring a similar approach for complex API reference documentation, which I'll investigate for future templates.
- [x] 3.17.1 Create expandable API reference proposal (4h)
  * **Dependency**: Based on feedback from 3.17
  * **Notes**: Developed a comprehensive proposal for applying multi-file principles to complex API reference documentation. Created the "Expandable View" concept that maintains the benefits of single-file reference documentation while addressing cognitive load concerns for particularly complex components. The proposal includes selection criteria, two technical implementation options (with client-side toggle as the preferred approach), user interface mockups, and a detailed pilot implementation plan for the WorkItemTrackingApi class. Outlined benefits, considerations with mitigations, resource requirements, timeline, and success metrics. This proposal directly addresses Jamie's suggestion to explore a similar approach for complex API reference documentation and builds on the successful multi-file structure implemented for tutorials.
- [x] 3.17.2 Budget constraints meeting (2h)
  * **Dependency**: Based on 3.17.1
  * **Collaboration**: Meeting with Morgan and Jamie to discuss budget constraints (1h)
  * **Notes**: Participated in a meeting with Morgan and Jamie to discuss the impact of budget constraints on our documentation hosting plans. We learned that we won't have budget for hosting the docs on a dedicated website, which affects our expandable view proposal and interactive elements. We brainstormed alternative approaches that work within GitHub-hosted markdown files, including a "split view" approach for complex components. Agreed to update the expandable view proposal and create a new proposal for the GitHub-compatible approach. Meeting notes are available in project-management/collaboration-sessions/budget-constraints-meeting-notes.md.
- [x] 3.17.3 Update expandable API reference proposal (3h)
  * **Dependency**: Based on 3.17.2
  * **Notes**: Updated the expandable view proposal to reflect the GitHub-only constraints. Documented the limitations of GitHub-hosted markdown files and adjusted the implementation approach accordingly. The updated proposal is available in project-management/documentation-standards/proposals/accepted/expandable-view-update.md.
- [x] 3.17.4 Create split view proposal for complex components (4h)
  * **Dependency**: Based on 3.17.2
  * **Notes**: Created a new proposal for the "split view" approach for complex components that works within GitHub-hosted markdown files. Included directory structure, navigation patterns, and visual hierarchy guidelines. Focused on the WorkItemTrackingApi class as the pilot implementation. The proposal is available in project-management/documentation-standards/proposals/accepted/split-view-github-approach.md.
- [x] 3.17.5 Develop WorkItemTrackingApi split view prototype (6h)
  * **Dependency**: Based on 3.17.4
  * **Notes**: Implemented a prototype of the WorkItemTrackingApi documentation using the split view approach. Created a main overview file with links to sub-files for methods, properties, examples, etc. Included consistent navigation between files and breadcrumb navigation at the top of each file. The prototype is available in api-reference/work-item-tracking/.
- [x] 3.17.6 Create API reference template based on split view approach (4h)
  * **Dependency**: Based on 3.17.5
  * **Notes**: Created a standardized template for complex API components based on the successful WorkItemTrackingApi prototype. The template includes files for the main overview, constructor, properties, methods directory, individual method files, examples, common scenarios, and error handling. Also created a comprehensive guide (TEMPLATE-GUIDE.md) for applying the template to complex components, including directory structure, placeholder replacement guide, selection criteria, navigation patterns, and best practices. The template is available in project-management/documentation-standards/templates/api-reference-template/.
