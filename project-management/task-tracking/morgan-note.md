# Note from Morgan: New Task Tracking System

Team,

I'm excited to announce a new approach to our task tracking that should make it easier for everyone to manage their work in a way that suits their individual workflow preferences.

## Key Changes

1. **Individual Task Directories**: Each team member now has their own directory in `project-management/task-tracking/` where you can organize your tasks however you prefer.

2. **Flexible Organization**: You're free to structure your task tracking in whatever way works best for you - whether that's a single file, multiple files by task category, or another approach entirely.

3. **Shared Visibility**: While the organization is flexible, please ensure that task status is visible to the team. This helps with coordination and dependency management.

4. **Template Available**: For those who want a starting point, there's a `team-task-template.md` file you can use as a reference, but it's completely optional.

## Taylor's Example

Taylor has already migrated her task tracking to the new system. Her approach uses a main task index file with links to detailed breakdowns for each major task category. Feel free to take a look at her organization in the `taylor/` directory for inspiration, but remember that you're free to use whatever approach works best for you.

## Getting Started

To get started with the new system:

1. Create a directory with your name in `project-management/task-tracking/`
2. Set up your task tracking files in whatever format works for you
3. Make sure your current task status is visible

## Bi-Weekly Reporting

We'll continue our bi-weekly status reporting. Please ensure your task tracking is up-to-date before our status meetings.

Let me know if you have any questions about the new system!

Best,
Morgan
