This directory contains my task tracking for the Azure DevOps Node API Documentation Project. As the Senior Technical Writer, I'm responsible for establishing the documentation architecture, content strategy, and technical standards.

## Current Focus

I'm currently focused on Task 3.20: Implementing template review feedback and finalizing templates. See [task-index.md](./task-index.md) for a complete overview of my tasks and their status.

## Task Organization

I've organized my tasks by major task categories, with each category having its own directory. Each directory contains an index.md file with the detailed task breakdown, including subtasks, notes, dependencies, and status.

## Notes

- Weekly status updates are submitted to Morgan bi-weekly
- Collaboration sessions are documented in the collaboration-sessions directory
- All task details are kept up-to-date as progress is made
