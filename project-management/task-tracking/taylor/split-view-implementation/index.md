# Task 9: Split-View Implementation Framework

## Overview

This task involves developing a comprehensive framework for implementing the split-view approach for complex API components. The split-view approach was developed as a solution to GitHub's markdown constraints, allowing us to break down complex API documentation into manageable, interconnected files while maintaining a cohesive user experience.

## Status: Not Started (Planned for Weeks 6-8)

Current focus: Preparing to begin after completing Task 3.20 (Template Review)

## Subtasks

### Framework Development
- [ ] 9.1 Document split-view approach rationale (3h)
  * **Dependency**: Based on completed work in 3.17.4-3.17.6
  * **Deliverable**: Comprehensive explanation of the split-view approach, its benefits, and usage scenarios
  * **Notes**: Will build on the existing split-view proposal and prototype implementation to create a definitive guide explaining the rationale, benefits, and appropriate use cases for the split-view approach.

- [ ] 9.2 Create complex component identification criteria (4h)
  * **Collaboration**: Consult with API specialists to define complexity thresholds
  * **Deliverable**: Clear guidelines for identifying which API components should use split-view
  * **Notes**: Will work with Alex and Riley to establish objective criteria for determining when a component is complex enough to warrant the split-view approach. Criteria will likely include number of methods, depth of inheritance, number of properties, and usage frequency.

- [ ] 9.3 Develop directory structure standards (3h)
  * **Deliverable**: Standardized directory structure for split-view implementations, with naming conventions
  * **Notes**: Will formalize the directory structure used in the WorkItemTrackingApi prototype, creating clear standards for file organization, naming conventions, and directory hierarchy.

- [ ] 9.4 Establish navigation patterns and breadcrumbs (4h)
  * **Collaboration**: Review with Jamie for UX optimization
  * **Deliverable**: Navigation templates, breadcrumb standards, and cross-linking patterns
  * **Notes**: Will work with Jamie to refine the navigation patterns used in the split-view approach, focusing on breadcrumb consistency, cross-linking between related files, and clear pathways for users to navigate the documentation.

- [ ] 9.5 Create implementation workflow for writers (4h)
  * **Deliverable**: Step-by-step guide for implementing split-view for a new API component
  * **Notes**: Will develop a comprehensive workflow guide for technical writers to follow when implementing the split-view approach for a new API component, including templates, checklists, and best practices.

- [ ] 9.6 Develop content organization guidelines (3h)
  * **Deliverable**: Guidelines for organizing content across multiple files while maintaining coherence
  * **Notes**: Will create guidelines for how to effectively distribute content across multiple files while maintaining a coherent narrative and avoiding duplication or fragmentation.

- [ ] 9.7 Create advanced example implementation (6h)
  * **Collaboration**: Pair with Casey to implement for a complex client
  * **Deliverable**: Complete example implementation for a complex API client with thorough documentation
  * **Notes**: Will work with Casey to implement the split-view approach for another complex API client (likely GitApi or BuildApi) to validate the framework and provide a second reference implementation.

### Implementation Planning
- [ ] 9.8 Identify candidates for split-view in Phase 2 (3h)
  * **Collaboration**: Review with Alex and Riley to identify complex clients
  * **Deliverable**: Prioritized list of API clients requiring split-view implementation
  * **Notes**: Will analyze the full set of API clients to identify which ones should use the split-view approach in Phase 2, creating a prioritized list based on complexity, usage frequency, and strategic importance.

- [ ] 9.9 Create implementation templates and scripts (4h)
  * **Collaboration**: Work with Dakota on potential automation
  * **Deliverable**: Templates and potential scripts to streamline split-view implementation
  * **Notes**: Will develop templates and explore automation options with Dakota to streamline the implementation process, potentially including scripts to generate directory structures and file templates.

- [ ] 9.10 Develop testing approach for split-view navigation (3h)
  * **Collaboration**: Consult with Jamie on usability testing approach
  * **Deliverable**: Testing checklist for split-view implementations
  * **Notes**: Will work with Jamie to develop a testing approach to validate the usability of split-view implementations, focusing on navigation paths, link integrity, and user experience.

- [ ] 9.11 Schedule training session for documentation team (2h)
  * **Deliverable**: Training materials and scheduled session for the team
  * **Notes**: Will develop training materials and schedule a session to train the documentation team on implementing the split-view approach.

- [ ] 9.12 Review framework with documentation team (2h)
  * **Deliverable**: Finalized framework based on team feedback
  * **Notes**: Will present the complete framework to the documentation team for review and feedback, incorporating suggestions to finalize the approach.

## Dependencies

- Requires completion of Task 3.20 (Template Review) before starting
- Builds on the work done in tasks 3.17.4-3.17.6 (Split-view proposal and prototype)
- Will inform Task 6 (API Reference Framework)

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk**: Split-view approach may increase maintenance overhead
  - **Mitigation**: Develop clear guidelines and potentially automation tools to streamline maintenance

- **Risk**: Navigation between split files may confuse users
  - **Mitigation**: Establish consistent navigation patterns and conduct usability testing

- **Risk**: GitHub's limitations may impact implementation options
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on solutions that work within GitHub's constraints while maximizing usability

## Notes

- The split-view approach was developed as a response to budget constraints that require hosting documentation exclusively on GitHub
- The WorkItemTrackingApi prototype has been well-received and demonstrates the viability of the approach
- This framework will be critical for scaling the approach across all complex API components
